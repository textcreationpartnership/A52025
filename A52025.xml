            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS <hi>Rationale</hi> or Account of the <hi>Turkiſh Empire,</hi> like the Subject it treats of, from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed and ſcattered pieces of Travel and Obſervation, is now arrived to a compleat Conſiſtency in this entire Frame and Compoſure, and looks like the Portraicture and becoming propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate Reſemblance of that moſt noble and potent STATE.</p>
            <p>And perhaps this Work and Endeavour was due and reſerved to this juncture of its Greatneſs, as wherein the power and force of this Monarch doth ſo preſſingly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately urge our conſideration and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reflections upon the Effects thereof; And as he draws nearer to us, ſo in reaſon he ſhould appear in larger and fuller Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, then the dangerleſs apprehenſions of
<pb facs="tcp:47532:3"/>former times have meaſured him out to our Curioſity.</p>
            <p>It is confeſt, that the joynt ſtock of thoſe famed Writers, who have engaged in this deſign, will ne're <hi>tantamount</hi> to the ſum of this Treatiſe, (wherein are ſome things notwithſtanding altogether rare and novel) but ſuch is the disjoyned, unredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced variety thereof, beſides the brevity and incompetence, as to particulars, unleſs all of them be conſulted, that never any plena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſatisfaction was yet given the world: As therefore in the <hi>Politicks,</hi> Dominions that lye compact and united to one another, though ſmaller, are preferred to richer and vaſter Territories, which are eloigned &amp; far diſtanced, for that the former can preſently ſuccour and relieve its fellows (as in the caſe of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi>) by ſo much may this Eſſay preſume of a Favourable Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and for that the one part doth now illuſtrate and ſet forth the other, and each ſupplies the whole, with every thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in this <hi>Government,</hi> by an eaſie and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect methodical conveyance, quite different from the projection of the former Draught, for the better cluing and manuduction of the Reader.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47532:3"/>And this being the firſt adventure this way, we have further Reaſon to hope, that the ingenious will readily approve it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering in this buſie world what uſe there is to be made of <hi>Time,</hi> and how much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and purveyance is ſaved in revolving ſo many Authors, as inquiſitive men, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon the purſuit of this ſtory, muſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe have recourſe to.</p>
            <p>It was ſaid ingeniouſly by <hi>Martial</hi> upon the <hi>Diſcomfitures</hi> of <hi>Pompey</hi> in ſo many places and different Countries:</p>
            <q>
               <l>—Jacere</l>
               <l>Uno non potuit tanta ruina loco.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And I may more fitly ſay of the Glories of this Monarchy,</p>

               <l>Debuit haud multis Gloria tanta locis.</l>

            <p>As it is thus reaſſembled from its divided pieces, in the manner of a reſurrection, we truſt it hath put on perfection, and with that immortality; that is to ſay, as long as the Turkiſh Name and Nation ſhall endure.</p>

               <p>HAving partly touched before ſome of the preceeding Caliphs, whoſe Catalogue hath been moſt imperfectly delivered, we come now to thoſe his ſucceſſors in this Nation of the Turks, whoſe better and invincible fortune hath preſerved their memory, and given the world a dreadful ſeries of thoſe <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, who although they be not Caliphs, <hi>nomine,</hi> the Mufti executing the ſacerdotal part of that dignity; yet are they ſo great by their Imperial power, and the ſubordination of the Preiſtly to his arbitrary commands, and alone pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The world heard not of this Slip, and branch of that Miſcreant Religion, till the fury of the Eaſtern <hi>Tartars</hi> had diſpoſſeſſed them of their worthleſs habitations in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comania,</hi> and at ſuch time alſo as the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had recovered themſelves from the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing Arms of <hi>Tangrolipix,</hi> and their Couſin <hi>Turks,</hi> a remainder of whom, under Sultan <hi>Aladin,</hi> yet maintained a kind of vagrant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality about <hi>Iconium,</hi> and thoſe parts of <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſs; whilſt thoſe acceſſional vagabonds under their Captain <hi>Solyman,</hi> the Chief of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47532:12"/>their Tribe arrived and obtained quarters, from their Countrymen, to repoſe their wearied and wretched Familes, who finding themſelves pent up in the narrowneſs of that precarious Territory: for the Chriſtians of the Greek Empire in <hi>Aſia,</hi> had ſtood with their arms in their hands to defend invaſions ſome good while before, their Captain <hi>Solyman</hi> diſigned an enlargement over the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> in which attempting to paſs to the other ſhore, and diſdaining to return to his former ſeat, he was carried away by the violence of the ſtream and drowned therein; to the great loſs and greif of his followers.</p>
               <p>He left behind him three Sons, but the <hi>Turks</hi> not then ſo nicely obſervant of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeniture, paſſing by the eldeſt, preferred <hi>Ertogrul,</hi> of whoſe courage and martial diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition they had early experience. He by his own enterpriſes and aſſiſtance given to the ſaid <hi>Sultan Aladin,</hi> ſo confirmed himſelf in that parcel of Land given and augmented to him, that he was dignified and known by the name of <hi>Ertogrul Beg,</hi> or Lord <hi>Ertogrul,</hi> which Title very aged, he left to his Son <hi>Oſman</hi> or <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> his youngeſt of three, whom the Tribe ſubſtituted in his Fathers place, from the ſame conſiderations with the former, about the year, 1300.</p>
               <p>This <hi>OTTOMAN,</hi> who is taken for the Founder of this Empire, was the firſt of the <hi>Turks,</hi> that quarrelled with the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:47532:13"/>(for which reaſon it may be ſuppoſed that Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal glory is attributed to him) by ſeizing ſeveral of the Neighbour Caſtles, as namely that of <hi>Cara Ciaſar,</hi> and afterwards others, as well by force as fraud, until thoſe frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits had rendred him rightly ſuſpect to the Greek Emperours, whoſe Innovations in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and perſecutions thereupon, diviſions and unnatural feuds, the Grand-Father, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Sons, ſupplanted one another, to the renverſment of that once Mighty State, opened a way to the mean and deſpicable Armes of this rude Shepherd, even into the heart of the Empire.</p>
               <p>For beſides other leſſer Skirmiſhes with the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> (neer to which, at <hi>Neapoly,</hi> he erected the ſeat of his new Kingdom, having gained the moſt part of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> the greater <hi>Miſia,</hi> and <hi>Bythinia,</hi> and cauſed himſelf to be called <hi>Sultan,</hi> after the death of <hi>Aladin</hi> of <hi>Iconium,</hi> in whom failed the <hi>Zelzuccian</hi> line, and whom he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as ſupreme,) he beſieged <hi>Pruſa,</hi> and there fought a great battel with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, in the confines of <hi>Phrygia</hi> and <hi>Bythinia,</hi> and after a long fight, obtained of them a bloody Victory; and ſo curbed that City by building Caſtles to keep them in, and block up the paſſages, that a while before he died, in the year 1327. It was rendred to his Son <hi>Orchanes,</hi> and made the Royal Seat of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Kings, where in 1328. he dyed of the Gout, aged ſixty nine
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47532:13"/>years, and was buried, a Monument of him remaining to this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ORCHANES</hi> his Son ſucceeded him, who had one onely Brother named <hi>Aladin,</hi> the peaceable enjoyer of a private life (for until the time of <hi>Bajazet</hi> the firſt, it was not the cuſtome to murder their brethren) this <hi>Orchanes</hi> had managed the Kingdom two years before his Fathers death, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the more expert in thoſe Arts by which his Father had enlarged his Dominions. He encountred with the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour <hi>Andronicus</hi> at <hi>Philochrene,</hi> where it was a drawn Battel, thereafter he ſurprized <hi>Nice,</hi> regayned from him by the <hi>Greeks;</hi> by ſtrong hand he carried <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> as his Captains took in the Caſtle of <hi>Abydos,</hi> in the Sreights of the <hi>Helleſpent,</hi> whence they had a fair and eaſie proſpect into <hi>Europe,</hi> as he did <hi>Callipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> upon the other ſame ſhore, now one of the Arſenals and chiefeſt Ports in thoſe Seas: and which gave him firm footing in <hi>Europe,</hi> which <hi>Orchanes</hi> at the advice of <hi>Solyman</hi> his Son, who conquered it, peopled with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razens</hi> out of the County of <hi>Caraſina.</hi> In the year 1359. died <hi>Orchanes,</hi> aged almoſt eighty years, with grief at the death of his ſaid Son <hi>Solyman,</hi> who was killed with a fall from his Horſe as he was a Hawking, leaving his Son <hi>Amurath</hi> to extend his new acqueſts, further into <hi>Thracia</hi> and <hi>Servia.</hi>

                  <hi>AM<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RATH</hi> a very politique and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Prince, at the very entrance of his Raign, Surprized <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and made the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who regarded not the loſs of <hi>Calipolis,</hi> to bethink themſelves of the danger of theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments. He was the firſt that began the order of the Janizaries, by taking Chriſtian Children from their Parents, and trayning them up in the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Laws and Manners, makes Leagues and Allyances with the <hi>Aſian</hi> Potentates to ſecure his deſignes upon <hi>Europe,</hi> as to cheriſh the diviſions among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> he did aid and aſſiſt the Emperour <hi>Cantacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenus</hi> againſt <hi>John Palaeologus</hi> the third, in the year <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> he invaded <hi>Servia,</hi> and took <hi>Nyſſa</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> thereof, and impoſed a great Tribute upon the Country. Returning thence he carried his victorious arms againſt <hi>Aladin,</hi> King of <hi>Caramania,</hi> his Son in Law, by whom he had been provoked in his abſence, and in a great Battel overthrew him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding afterwards he reſtored him to his Kingdom upon conditions of homage. From hence he came back again to <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> which he over-ran, and in a Mortal Battel ſlew and overcame <hi>Lazarus</hi> the <hi>Deſpot</hi> of <hi>Servia,</hi> in the fatal plains of <hi>Coſſova,</hi> where he himſelf proudly ſurveying the carriage of the field, was ſtabed in the belly by a wounded Chriſtian Souldier named <hi>Miles Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belitz,</hi> who ſtaggering to approach him, was by his own command admitted to his perſon;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47532:14"/>ſince which time no Ambaſſador is ſuffered to come before the Grand Seignior, unleſs his arms be guarded by one on each ſide. This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the year 1390. in the 31. year of his reign. He was interred at <hi>Pruſa</hi> with his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BAJAZET,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Gilderun</hi> or Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for his fierce and ſudden violence of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, having ſtrangled his only brother <hi>Jacup Zelebi</hi> (ſo that he was the introducer of this moſt inhumane practiſe) ſucceeded his Father <hi>Amurath,</hi> and vanquiſhed and ſubdued <hi>Mark</hi> the Prince of <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> as he did alſo <hi>Lazarus</hi> the new <hi>Deſpot</hi> of <hi>Servia</hi> and ſpoyled <hi>Valachia,</hi> making the Vayvod thereof his Tributary. In <hi>Aſia</hi> he tyrannized over the Mahometan Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the ſucceſſors of <hi>Aladin,</hi> and in arrogance beſieged <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> twice, but in vain. He ſubdued <hi>Theſſaly</hi> and <hi>Phoci,</hi> defeated <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> at <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> aſſiſted by an Army of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Burgundians</hi> with a terrible ſlaughter; ſo that the Turkiſh Power was firſt dreadful by his Puiffance. He again vanquiſhed the ſtubborn <hi>Aladin</hi> of <hi>Caramania</hi> with his Kingdom, and the great Cities of <hi>Amaſia</hi> and <hi>Sebaſtia:</hi> in fine, uncivilly treating the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> ſent in behalf of the poor Princes of <hi>Aſia,</hi> he was by him neer <hi>Sebaſtia,</hi> after a moſt bloody diſpute overcome and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoner, and put into an iron Cage, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about for <hi>Tamerlane</hi>'s Horſe-block, until with impatience at his two years ſlavery, he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47532:15"/>broke out his brains againſt the grates, in the year 1399.</p>
               <p>This overthrow ſo blaſted the greatneſs of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family, that it was hudled up in a general confuſion betwixt the intereſts and claims of <hi>Bajazet's</hi> Sons. <hi>Solyman</hi> his eldeſt Son poſſeſſed himſelf of his Conqueſts in <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſeated at <hi>Adrianople, Mahomet</hi> his younger at <hi>Amaſia,</hi> and defended his <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Provinces againſt the invaſion of the <hi>Tartars;</hi> ſome petty Princes whereof had thoſe aſſigned to them by <hi>Tamerlane.</hi> In concluſion, <hi>Muſa</hi> the ſecond bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther releaſed out of his Captivity, with his Fathers dead body, by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> deſtroyed <hi>Solyman,</hi> and ſeized himſelf of his Kingdom; of which not long after, <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> diſpoſſeſſed <hi>Muſa</hi> and ſtrangled him, and united the whole entire Dominion under him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He was but 15 years old when he began to reign, yet ſuch was his prudence and proweſs, that he reſtored this collapſed Empire in a few years. He died in 1422. and was buried at <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> neer his Father <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who hath a ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Monument in that City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AM<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RATH,</hi> now the ſecond, being ſent for to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> was there by the Baſhaws, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the appointment of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Throne. His firſt work was the ſuppreſſion of a counterfeit Muſtapha the ſon of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> whom he cauſed to be ſtrangled. He next won <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> with the greateſt part of <hi>Atolia</hi> and <hi>Achaia,</hi> and at the ſame time pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47532:15"/>foully upon the King of <hi>Epirus,</hi> the Father of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> by poyſon, as tyrannically upon the petty Princes of <hi>Aſia;</hi> whence he converted his Army againſt the <hi>Deſpot</hi> of <hi>Servia,</hi> whom he vallalized, but invaded <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> with loſs; whereupon by much intreaty he obtained peace of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liadſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who breaking his faith ſo ſolemnly given, and invading <hi>Amurath,</hi> engaged in a proſperous War with the <hi>Caraman</hi> King in <hi>Aſia,</hi> was by <hi>Amurath</hi> recalled thus into <hi>Europe,</hi> moſt miſerably defeated at <hi>Varna,</hi> and there ſlain. The remainder of his long reign was ſpent in vexation at the ſucceſſes of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> whom with all his power he was not able to reduce, whereupon he retired to a Monaſtery, and with grief he died, leaving the Government to his Son <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>MAHOMET</hi> was a perfect Athieſt, of no Faith or Religion, murdered his Brethren, ſubdued <hi>Menteſia,</hi> and took <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> on the 29. of <hi>May</hi> 1453. and thereby put an end to the Greek Empire, and cauſed himſelf to be ſtiled Emperor. To omit the known ſtory of his Concubine <hi>Irene,</hi> we muſt paſs with him to the ſiege of <hi>Belgrade</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> whence he was forced to riſe with great loſs and diſhonour, having been himſelf dangerouſly wounded, afterwards he practiſed upon the Princes of <hi>Valachia,</hi> and brought a horrible devaſtation on the Country, and deſigned the like Treachery upon <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> but by him
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47532:16"/>worſted before <hi>Croja;</hi> nevertheleſs he gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Sordea</hi> from the <hi>Venetians</hi> after a vain and bloody ſiege by Treatie and Compoſition. He attempted and ſtaggered the <hi>Perſian</hi> King alſo: In vain likewiſe he beſieged <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and invaded <hi>Italy;</hi> as his purpoſes againſt the <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manian</hi> King were diſappointed by his death, not without ſuſpicion of poyſon, 1481. He was buried at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BAJAZET,</hi> his Son ſucceeded him, and firſt managed a War againſt his brother <hi>Zemes,</hi> who flying to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and thence ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> was poyſoned by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth, bribed thereunto by <hi>Bajazet.</hi> He prepared for an expedition to <hi>Hungary,</hi> but durſt not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute it, the effect ſpeeding it ſelf to his great loſs upon <hi>Valachia</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> with more indifferent fortune he combated <hi>Caitheius</hi> the Sultan of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but finally vanquiſhed the <hi>Caramanian</hi> King, and united that Kingdom to his own. He quarrelled the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and took and loſt ſeveral places: The end as the beginning of his reign, was diſquieted with the unnatural diſloyaltie of his Sons, <hi>Cocutus, Acho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi> and <hi>Selymus,</hi> at whoſe inſtance he was at laſt poyſoned by a Jew his Phyſician, in the year, 1512.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SELTM<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> began his reign, not only with the death of his Father, but the murder of his brother <hi>Corcutus,</hi> and five of his brother <hi>Acho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>'s
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47532:16"/>Sons, makes war againſt <hi>Hyſmael</hi> the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Sophy, with whom he had a ſignal encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beyond <hi>Euphrates;</hi> but ſuch was the equal fortune of the day, that <hi>Selymus</hi> content to have coped perſonally with that renowned and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Potentate, retreated back to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whence he threatned <hi>Hungary,</hi> but the force and fury of his Army fell upon <hi>Campſon Gaurus</hi> and <hi>Tomombeus,</hi> Sultans of the Mamaluke Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, whom he overthrew in two fatal battels at <hi>Singa,</hi> and in the City of <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> which with <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> were annexed to his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. In his return hence, as he was medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating an uſeful expedition into <hi>Hungary,</hi> being ſeized by a canker in his back, he breathed out his revengeful ſoul in the year 1520.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SOLYMAN</hi> his only Son (not ſo ſtrange, conſidering his Father was a moſt Martial Prince) ſucceeded to the Throne; in whoſe reign this great Empire roſe to its higheſt pinnacle and culmination of Glory. He was ſirnamed the Magnificent for the nobleneſs of his Acts: He firſt conquered the Iſle of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> defeated King <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and ſlew him at <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haez,</hi> and beſieged <hi>Vienna,</hi> but in vain. In fine, this was the potent Monarch that conquered <hi>Hungary,</hi> took <hi>Buda Strigonum, Alba Regalis,</hi> in pretence of the right of King <hi>John</hi> and his Orphant elected by the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Nobility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the due title of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> He likewiſe threatned <hi>Italy</hi> with his Fleets, and aided the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47532:17"/>
                  <hi>French</hi> King by them againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, as he likewiſe combated the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings, <hi>Hyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> and <hi>Tamas:</hi> He beſieged <hi>Malta</hi> by his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> but was there worſted. Towards the latter end of his reign he was enjealouſed by his Paramour <hi>Recotane</hi> againſt the Noble Prince <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> his eldeſt Son by another wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to make way for her children, and <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> ſtrangled, as <hi>Solyman</hi> was upon a pretended Expedition againſt the <hi>Perſians.</hi> In his ſeventh and laſt expedition into <hi>Hungary</hi> he died, at the ſiege of <hi>Zigerh,</hi> 1566. having made <hi>Hungary</hi> a Province of <hi>Turkie. Selymus</hi> having met his Fathers Corps about <hi>Belgrade</hi> (having been pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily advertiſed of his death by <hi>Mahomet Baſsa,</hi> who had concealed it from the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> as is uſual in that Government, to avoid the mutiny of the Janizaries) was there ſaluted Emperor, but not admitted to the Seraglio at his return to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> till he had given them a large Donative. He was a Prince no way like his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but given to exceſs and debauchery, which made him willing to make peace with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Perſians;</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by his Captains he gained <hi>Cyprus</hi> from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as he loſt the famous battel of <hi>Lepanto</hi> to <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> Toward the end of his reign he ſubdued <hi>Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Vala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia</hi> more abſolutely to the Turkiſh ſubjection, as he alſo reduced the Kingdom of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Guletta,</hi> taken from <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſſa</hi> by <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth 42 years before. He died at the 51 year of his age, ſpent with wine
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47532:17"/>and women, and in the year of the Incarnation 1574.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AM<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RATH</hi> the third ſucceeded him, having cauſed his five Brethren to be ſtrangled in his ſight: He was a Prince not vicious as his Father, but given to peace, and addicted to a quiet life, and managed his Arms as his Father had done before him, by Lieutenants, who were famous men in their times, as <hi>Sinan, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hates Muſtapha,</hi> and <hi>Oſnan Baſſa</hi> the firſt and laſt of whom, ſorely plagued the <hi>Perſians,</hi> againſt whom <hi>Amurath</hi> was provoked by a dream and viſion, and took from them the Province of <hi>Media,</hi> now called <hi>Sirvan,</hi> a great part of the greater <hi>Armenia,</hi> and the Regal City of <hi>Tauris</hi> after two or three diſmal encounters; they confirmed likewiſe the <hi>Crim-Tartar</hi> in a ſurer obedience to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family. The ſame <hi>Sinan</hi> waged a fierce War in <hi>Hungary,</hi> took <hi>Raab</hi> and other Towns, but they were all reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered again, and he after many grand atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhamefully driven to flie out of <hi>Hungary,</hi> by <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> ſince which time until this day, the Turks power was never formidable in <hi>Europe. Amurath</hi> died in the year 1595. having raigned 21. years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>MAHOMET</hi> the third, his eldeſt Son ſucceeded him, commencing his reign with the bloody Maſſacre of 18. of his Brethren, and ten of his Fathers Wives and Concubines
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47532:18"/>thought to be impregnate with Poſthume iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, that ſo he might make ſure work. He was dreaded before his aſſumption to the Crown, to have been of a fierce and untractable nature, but he proved a meer ſwine; for he was memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for nothing of military concernment, but his perſonal appearance in <hi>Hungary</hi> with 200000 men, where he took <hi>Agria,</hi> and was preſent at the battel of <hi>Kereſture</hi> in 1596. the ſecond of his reign, out of which field he run in the beginning of the Fight, and would never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to hear of an engagement again; ſomething was done by his Captains in <hi>Hungary,</hi> but as much was done againſt them, and things conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued there in <hi>ſtatu quo</hi> to his death, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his unweildy Fat, under which he could not ſtand; in the year 1603.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ACHMAT</hi> his Son, a ſtripling ſucceeded him, a Prince proud and imperious, yet no way Martial: he had ſome Piques with the <hi>Perſian</hi> who threatned him hard, and made him glad to urge a peace with <hi>Rodolphus</hi> the Emperor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo perplexed with his Rebels in <hi>Aſia.</hi> Like his Predeceſſors he was engaged in a <hi>Valachian</hi> and <hi>Moldavian</hi> War, which he finiſhed with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, taking the Princes <hi>Alexander, Bougdan</hi> and <hi>Coresky</hi> Priſoners, the latter of whom made a great buſtle in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court, by his eſcape out of priſon. This Sultan <hi>Achmat</hi> was much given to women, and with too frequent uſe of them died young, at the age of 30. years in 1617.</p>

                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:47532:18"/>As to his Sons and Succeſſors, having ſpoken of them in the modern Hiſtory of the Turks hereto adjoyned, this is their brief Character: <hi>Muſtapha</hi> the Brother German of <hi>Achmat</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him, becauſe of the minority of his Sons, to the Government, was a bookiſh Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical man, and bred in the fear of death all his dayes. <hi>Oſman, Achmat</hi>'s Son, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned him, a Prince of 16. years of age, was a very forward active Prince: he quarrelled with the <hi>Poles,</hi> and perceiving in that War the ſloath and cowardlineſs of the Janizaries, by which he came off with diſhonour, by the advice of <hi>Derlavir</hi> the grand Viſier, an experienced ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, and a great Captain on the <hi>Aſian</hi> ſide, intended the extirpation of them, and the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a new Militia; which deſign being ſented, was the cauſe of both their deaths, <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> being ſtrangled in priſon, and the Viſier cut in pieces, by the tumultuous mutinies of thoſe Bands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>STAPHA</hi> was re-inthroned, but was the ſame man, and again depoſed by the ſame Janizaries; and Sultan <hi>Morat,</hi> the brother of <hi>Achmat</hi> eſtabliſhed. He was as warlike a Prince as his brother or any of his Progenitors, for he recovered <hi>Bagdat,</hi> taken by the <hi>Perſians</hi> during theſe changes at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and there in proſecution of his Brothers intentions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the perdition of thoſe Janizaries, but
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47532:19"/>dying there, they eſcaped the puniſhment due to ſuch Rebels as embrue their hands in their Princes blood. <hi>Oſman</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>That he was no Emperor, but a Pay-maſter to a company of Droans,</hi> meaning thoſe Souldiers. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> his Brother and Succeſſor, was nothing like him in courage, however he bravadoed the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and began a War there for one of his Women, a more honourable cauſe being not like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him. And what his Son <hi>Mahomet</hi> will prove muſt be leſt to his appearance in perſon this Campania: but if he be like his Viſier, as they ſay he is in moſt things, he is moſt juſtly to be dreaded.</p>

               <p>For to ſpeak nothing of ancient times, in the 73. year after Chriſt, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was taken and deſtroyed by <hi>Titus,</hi> with the ſlaughter and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of infinite thouſands. In the year 136. it was reſtored by <hi>Aelius Adrianus,</hi> new-named <hi>Aelia,</hi> and given in poſſeſſion to the Jews. In the

               <p>In the year 1097. in a general Council for the delivery of the Holy-Land,<note place="margin">Holyland.</note> the <hi>Croſſed</hi> Knights were inſtituted throughout Chriſtendom, and <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bulloygne</hi> choſen General of three hundred thouſand footmen, and one hundred thouſand horſe. Theſe Knights did many famous acts; recovered the Land, inſtituted a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and though ſometime with loſs, continued ſome defence thereof, until the year of our Lord 1517. and then was it overcome by the Turkiſh Armies, of the aforeſaid victorious <hi>Selymus,</hi> who at this day retain it in miſerable ſervitude under a certain Tribute or impoſition upon ſuch Chriſtians as are permitted to live here.</p>
               <p>There are now therefore two or more Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, or Religious Houſes, where Fryars do abide, and make a good commodity of ſhewing the Sepulchre of Chriſt, and other Monuments unto ſuch Chriſtian Pilgrims as do uſe ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly to go in Pilgrimage to the Holy Land.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>GALILIE</hi> upon the North is invironed with the ſteep hills of <hi>Libanus</hi> and <hi>Antilibanus,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Weſt with <hi>Phenicia,</hi> upon the Eaſt with <hi>Coeloſyria,</hi> and upon the South with <hi>Samaria,</hi> and <hi>Arabia</hi> the deſart. The ſoil is moſt fruitful, yielding all ſorts of Trees, and divided by <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan:</hi> upon whoſe banks ſtand very many Towns and Villages, and ſo well watered, either with mountain Torrents, or Springs, that no part thereof lyeth unmanured.</p>
               <p>The Country is the more famous, for that in it ſtandeth (amongſt the rude mountains) the ſmall Villages of <hi>Nazareth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nazareth.</note> the place of our Lords conception: And at this day, there is a ſmall Chappel archt and built under ground, whereinto a man muſt deſcend by ſtairs: Here (ſome ſay) the Angel appeared unto <hi>Mary,</hi> and foretold her that ſhe ſhould conceive and bring forth our Lord.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants are <hi>Arabians,</hi> ſhort and thick men, rudely apparelled, and weaponed with Bows, Swords and Daggers.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47532:38"/>champian, pleaſant, fruitful, and very well watered with freſh and ſweet water. The City is now ruinated: but as for pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light it was inferior to no other. It is ſcituated upon the ſide of a Hill, the eighth part of a mile, from whence a man may behold the ruines of a great Temple: whereupon (as men ſay) Chriſt ſate, when he asked water of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.

               <p>The tribe of <hi>Juda</hi> ſo named it, and in it, as in the reſt of <hi>Paleſtina</hi> were very many worthy Cities, whereof <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was the chief ſeat of their Princes,<note place="margin">Jeruſalem.</note> the poſſeſſion of the Patriarchs, Prophets and Apoſtles: the original place of our faith, and the glory of the Chriſtian world. By the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> at this day it is called <hi>Godz,</hi> or <hi>Chutz:</hi> It ſtandeth on an eminent place, as whereunto a man muſt always aſcend.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Jeroms</hi> opinion was, that it ſtood not only in the heart of <hi>Judeaa,</hi> but in the very cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the world, as having <hi>Aſia</hi> on the Eaſt, <hi>Europe</hi> on the Weſt, upon the South <hi>Lybia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and upon the North, <hi>Scythia, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia, Perſia,</hi> with thereſidue of the Pontique Nations.</p>
               <p>What the glory hereof hath been, may be conjectured out of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who reporteth, that in the beginning of the Siege, it contained two hundred thouſand ſouls. At this day it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47532:38"/>numbereth not above five thouſand inhabitants, although many Pilgrims daily reſort thither in a good conſcience, and for devotion ſake.</p>
               <p>It was once ſtrongly and fairly walled, but now weakly, and therein it ſheweth nothing ſo famous as the Sepulchre of our Saviour Chriſt, whoſe Temple incircleth the whole Mount of <hi>Calvary,</hi> ſcituated upon a plain plot of ground, high, round, and open at the top,<note place="margin">The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre of Chriſt.</note> from whence it receiveth light: but the Sepulchre it ſelf is covered with an archt Chappel cut out of the main Marble, and left unto the cuſtody of the Latin Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever is deſirous to ſee this Sepulchre, muſt pay nine Crowns to the Turk: ſo that this tribute is yearly worth unto him a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable revenue.</p>
               <p>One hundred and eight foot diſtant from this Tomb, is the Mount (called the Mount <hi>Calva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>) whereon our Saviour Chriſt was crucified by the treacherous Jews. In this place are many other religious Reliques. And the pilgrims which come thither, are alwayes lodged accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own profeſſion; the Latines with the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> without the City, by Mount <hi>Sion:</hi> the Graecians are lodged with the <hi>Caloirean</hi> Greeks, dwelling within the City by the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre: And ſo every other Nation, <hi>Abeſſines, Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, Armenians, Neſtorians,</hi> and <hi>Maronites,</hi> who all have their proper &amp; peculiar Chappels. Thoſe Franciſcans, which follow the Latin Church, and are for the moſt part <hi>Italians,</hi> were wont to create the Knights of the Sepulchre, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47532:39"/>to give teſtimonial unto Pilgrims of their being there.</p>
               <p>Without this City is the valley of <hi>Jeboſophat,</hi> and therein the Tombs of the bleſſed Lady and Saint <hi>Anne.</hi> The territory adjoyning is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruitful in Vines, Apples, Almonds, Figs and Oyl: the mountains are no leſs ſtored with trees, wild beaſts and ſpiceries.</p>
               <p>Beſides <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> here ſtandeth <hi>Bethlem,</hi> now deſtroyed, and ſhewing nothing worth looking on, ſave a great and ſtately Monaſtery of the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> within which is the place where Chriſt was born. <hi>Rama</hi> is now likewiſe ruinated; the Arches and Ciſterns which are now remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the witneſs of <hi>Bellonius</hi> his own eye, are greater then thoſe of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> but not ſo thick.</p>

But without the Seraglio are alſo diverſe honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Offices for the Government of the Empire, the chief whereof is their Mufti or Pope, who onely hath plenary power to interpret their Law and Alcoran. In the ſecond Rank, are their <hi>Coldeleſchers,</hi> viz. Chief Juſtices, and they have
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47532:54"/>the hearing and deciding of all temporal ſuits between party and party. In ancient times they were but two, one in <hi>Rum Ili</hi> or Europe, the other in <hi>Natolia:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The great Officers of the Empire.</note> but <hi>Selymus</hi> the third, added a third equal in authority to the other two, over the Provinces of <hi>Egypt, Syria, Arabia,</hi> and part of <hi>Armenia.</hi> Theſe chief Judges have juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over all inferiour Juſtices, or Caddies in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Provinces, and by them are nominated, but confirmed by the Grand Signior himſelf. After the <hi>Cadeleſchers,</hi> followeth the Vice-Roy <hi>Baſſaes</hi> (Counſellours of eſtate) whoſe number is uncertain; in old time three or four, but of late twelve. The Preſident of theſe the Turks term Vice-Roy Azem, and in truth, is a perſonage of great dignity and authority in managing the affairs of the State, as the man with whom the Grand Signior doth only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his weightieſt intentions, and ſecreteſt deliberations.</p>
               <p>In the next place appear the Beglerbegs (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <hi>del Campo</hi>) the chief whereof is he that is tearmed of <hi>Romania</hi> or <hi>Graecia:</hi>

               <p>Before the laſt war of <hi>Perſia,</hi> this Empire was under-governed by forty Beglerbegs, who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had under them two hundred and ſeventy Sanjacks (but ſince thoſe times this number hath

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47532:56"/>and <hi>Mecca</hi> both in his own Dominions, and is not forced in ſome untoward occurrences to apply himſelf to forreign diſpenſations. And ſometimes the Grand Signior makes not nice to remove his Arch-Clergy-man, as well as other of his Tribe, if they once interfere with the State, yet without any tumult or Faction, or ſcarce any blemiſh to the perſons of the men, who ſhall be reputed Saints, and ſo Calenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; even if put to death, ſuch is the radical opinion of their unſtained ſanctity and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.</p>
               <p>As to the Baſhaws and Beglerbegs, and their honours for life, their poſterity being reckoned for no more then common Turks, unleſs their own worth ſhall raiſe them, by which all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent combination of families is prevented; as we ſhall ſpeak of more liberally in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>In the time of <hi>Selymus,</hi> were reckoned one million and thirty three thouſand Chriſtian ſouls to live within his Dominions,<note place="margin">The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Chriſtian Vaſſals.</note> not account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe that enjoyed freedom of conſcience by priviledge, nor thoſe that then were ſubject to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Sultan, whom the ſaid <hi>Selymus</hi> vanquiſhed, but now they are in far greater numbers.</p>

               <p>And firſt concerning his opinion of Heaven, whither he ſaith he was carried by an Angel, and let in <hi>Gabriel</hi> the Porter there; where he ſaw a Cock ſo great, that ſtanding upon the Moon, his Coxcomb reacht into the imperial Heaven,

Then is every man loaden with his ſins in a ſatchel and hung about his neck, with which they paſs on a narrow weak bridge over the mouth of Hell; now thoſe that be heavy laden break the bridge and fall therein, but ſuch as have but few ſins paſs over ſecurely; on the other ſide of the bridge ſtands <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who ſhall be transformed into the ſhape of a mighty Ram, full of locks and long fleeces of wool, in which all his Sectaries like Fleas ſhall ſhroud themſelves, then will he jump into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, and ſo convey them all thither.</p>
               <p>Paradiſe he deſcribed to be as many miles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47532:58"/>as there be Atoms in the Sun, and that it is encloſed with a wall of ninety times refined gold, ten thouſand miles high, and three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thick; it hath ſeven Gates to enter in at, and is divided into ſeven ſpacious Gardens, and thoſe ſubdivided into ſeventy times ſeven ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places of delight. In this place he promiſes to his Muſſel-men, or true Believers, all ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual pleaſures and delights imaginable; namely, that they ſhould have garments of ſilk, with all ſorts of colours, bracelets of gold and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Parlors and Banquetting-houſes upon floods and Rivers, veſſels of Gold and Silver, Angels ſerving them, bringing in Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Flaggons Milk and Wine, curious Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings rarely furniſhed, Cuſhions, Pillows and Down-beds, moſt beautiful Women to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them, Maidens and Virgins with twinkling eyes, Gardens and Orchards with Arbors, Fountains, Springs, and all manner of pleaſant fruit, Rivers of Milk, Honey and ſpiced Wine; all manner of ſweet Odours, Perfumes, and fragrant Scents, yea whatſoever the fleſh ſhall deſire to have. In this Paradiſe (ſaith <hi>Mahe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>) there is a Table of Diamond, ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand dayes journey long; this is for men to feaſt upon, ſitting on chairs of Gold and Pearl. <hi>Gabriel</hi> the Porter of Paradiſe hath ſeventy thouſand keys which belong to his Office, and every key is ſeven thouſand miles long; queſtionleſs he muſt be very ſtrong, or elſe thoſe keys muſt needs tire him. Here (ſaith the Alcoran) ſhall men
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47532:59"/>tumble in all manner of pleaſure, repoſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fair beds lined with Crimſon; there ſhall they gather the fruits of the Garden to their contentment; there ſhall they enjoy the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of fair and beautiful Damoſels, whoſe hairs be threds of Gold, their eyes of Diamonds as big as the Moon, their lips of Cherries, their teeth of Pearl, their tongues of Rubies, their cheeks of Coral, their noſes of Jaſper, their fore-heads of Saphyr, their eyes exceeding black, and bodies exceeding white, round fac'd, ſweet, amorous and beautiful; there ſhall they ſpend the time with theſe Virgins in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Arbors, who being enjoyed, ſhall have their Virginities again renewed as often as loſt. In the midſt of this delightful place (ſaith he) is a very high ſpreading Tree, higher then all the Mountains in the world, were they heap'd one upon another, and ſo broad that it ſhadeth all Paradiſe. The trunk of this extraordinary rate tree is all of Diamond, the leaves of Ophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian gold, and the boughs of jet; each leaf hath an antick ſhape, having on one ſide grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the name of God, and on the other that of <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such groſs abſurdities did he publiſh to catch the credulous inconſiderate multitude; but his devices are ſo ridiculous, that a wiſe man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuſe but ſmile at his conceits in pleaſure: this indeed hath made many of the moſt ſerious of them, to miſlike his inventions and ſenſual delights; amongſt the reſt hear <hi>Avicena,</hi> one of his own Sect; <hi>Mahomet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47532:59"/>as a Law which ſheweth the perfection of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity to conſiſt in thoſe things which concern the body, whereas the wiſe and ſages of old had a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſire to expreſs the felicity of the ſoul then of the body; as for the bodily felicity, though it were granted them, yet they regarded it not nor eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, in compariſon of the felicity which the ſoul requireth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor were his ridiculous fopperies of Hell leſs then the other; namely, that it was in the navel of the world, compaſſed with a large high wall of attractive Adamant, having ſeven gates of flaming braſs to enter in at; that it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſeveral Cells or Dungeons, whereof ſome were more loathſom and fuller of torments then others, which are prepared for thoſe ſouls who have higheſt tranſgreſſed. Some of theſe Caves (ſaith he) are ſo deep, that a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone in a thouſand years cannot attain to the bottom, and other places are without bottom: In the deſcent of theſe deep Caves or Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are placed ſharp pikes and ſwords to wound and torment the ſouls that move there. Theſe Dungeons are full of flaming oyle and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which ſtriketh ſuch a terror, that the very Devils themſelves do howl, ſcrich and rage there beyond meaſure: other Dungeons be full of ſerpents, toads, and all manner of venemous and noiſon creatures that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. Here ſhall the wicked eat of the fruit of the Tree <hi>Zacon,</hi> which being in their guts ſhall flame like ſulphur, they ſhall drink boyling wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and every day have alteration of new tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47532:60"/>Some Rivers (ſaith he) be full of Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles, others ſo cold as makes them gnaſh and chatter, others boyl with violence of heat; yet (ſaith the Alcoran) ſhall not theſe pains en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for ever; for after ſo many thouſand years, when each ſoul hath ſuffered according to the demerits of the ſins which he hath committed, then ſhall they be delivered by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> (yea his charity is ſo great, that he will deliver the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils alſo) firſt changing their affrighting ſhapes into others more tolerable, and then by waſhing them in a River flowing out of Paradiſe called <hi>Alcanzar,</hi> they ſhall become whiter then the driven ſnow, and from thence forward ſing <hi>Lala hillulaes</hi> unto <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His doctrine of Angels was, that they were either good or bad, yet both ſubject to death; the good as conſiſting of flame, becauſe <hi>Lucifer</hi> an Angel, by ambition was caſt out of Paradiſe; the bad Angels are impriſoned in Dogs, Swine, Toads, Wolves, Bears, Tygers, &amp;c. After the Judgement day they muſt be tormented in Hell ſome millions of years, and afterwards be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As abſurd and ridiculous were his opinions concerning our Saviour Chriſt, as that the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi> conceived him by ſmelling to a Roſe preſented to her by the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> and that he was born out of her breaſts: alſo, that he was not crucified, but <hi>Judas</hi> or ſome other wicked thief in his ſtead, Chriſt being ſeparated from them by a cloud that covered him, which came from Heaven: that at the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:47532:60"/>laſt day the Righteous ſhould enter into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Jews under the banner of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Chriſtians under the banner of Chriſt, and the <hi>Saracens</hi> under his banner.</p>
               <p>Having with theſe and the like odd whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies, patched up his Alcoran, to give it the better credit, that the people might imagine it to come from Heaven, he deviſed this cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way; He ſecretly cauſed a wild Aſs to be taken and bound, his Alcoran being fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written about his neck; then as he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the people, he pretended a ſudden rapture of ſome extraordinary thing that was revealed to him from above, and with a loud voice ſpake to the people, <hi>Ye have deſired a Law, behold God hath ſent you a Law from Heaven; go to ſuch a Deſart, there ſhall ye find an Aſs, and a Book tyed about his neck, which will direct you in the wayes which God hath commanded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thereupon the people ran in great haſt, and (as they could do no other) found it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he had ſaid; ſo with great pomp they bring back the Aſs with the book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his neck, ſuitable to the bearer; and now (as thoroughly convinced) they give great honour to this their new Prophet. Thus were theſe ſilly ſouls deluded by this cunning Impoſtor, who worſe then <hi>Heroſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> purchaſed to himſelf a laſting name by by the grandeſt wickedneſs that could be committed. We ſhall conclude this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter with a brief Epitomy or Summary of

                  <head>A Summary of the Religion of the <hi>TURKS.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe Turks believe one ſole God, in one ſole Perſon, Creator of heaven and earth, the rewarder of the good, and puniſher of the wicked; who hath created Paradiſe for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of the righteous, and Hell for the laſt puniſhment of crimes. They believe that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was a very great Prophet, whom God ſent in the world to teach men the way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and call themſelves <hi>Muſulmans,</hi> that is to ſay, recommended to God, or ſaved.</p>
                  <p>They believe the Decalogue of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and are obliged to obſerve it; they celebrate Friday as the Chriſtians Sunday, that day they aſſemble in Temples at noon to pray.</p>
                  <p>They are obliged to pray five times a day, <hi>viz.</hi> in the morning, at noon, at the evening, when the Sun ſetteth, and an hour within night.</p>
                  <p>They faſt the month, or moon, which they call <hi>Ramazan;</hi> during this month, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drink nor ear all the day, until the Sun be ſet, but in the night drink and eat according to their appetites, fleſh and fiſh, except the fleſh
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47532:61"/>of ſwine, and wine that is all times forbidden them; after this faſt they have the feaſt of great <hi>Bairan,</hi> as the Chriſtians Eaſter after Lent.<note place="margin">In this <hi>Bayran</hi> or <hi>Byram,</hi> laſting 3 days, they are very jolly, and give Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents like our New years gifts eſpecially the Grand Seignior gives and receives much.</note> They are great founders of Temples and Hoſpitals, and are obliged to give to the poor the firſt day of the year, the Tyth of what they have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed during the preceding year.</p>
                  <p>They believe, that after being well waſht, ſaying ſome prayer appropriate to that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, they have alſo the ſoul purified from all filthineſs of ſin, which is the cauſe that they waſh and bath often, eſpecially before they pray.</p>
                  <p>They have no Sacrament but Circumciſion; they cauſe their children to be circumciſed at the age of ſeven or eight years; and when they can pronounce theſe words, <hi>La ilha ilha allha Mehemet raſoul allha,</hi> that is, There is but one God, <hi>Mahomet</hi> is his Prophet and Apoſtle; this is their profeſſion of Faith; nevertheleſs there is no mention of Circumciſion in all the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran;</hi> they ſay they obſerve it in imitation of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whoſe Law is recommended to them by <hi>Mahomet;</hi> they believe that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> was brought to him at ſeveral times by the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> in the City of <hi>Mecca,</hi> and that of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> becauſe the Jews and Chriſtians had altered the holy Scriptures, and the Law of God.</p>
                  <p>They are permitted to have four wives, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at the ſame time, and as many Concubines as they are able to maintain.</p>
                  <p>They can put away their wives when they think fit, paying them what they promiſed
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47532:62"/>them in contract of marriage, and marry again at their pleaſure; but the women are bound to tarry until they are aſſured that they are not with child before they marry again; and their husbands are obliged to keep, and take the care of the child. The children which they have by their ſlaves are indifferently eſteemed with thoſe of their wives, and are all held as legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</p>
                  <p>They have Temples, Colledges, and Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals well revenued; they have covents of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, that live exemplary; obey their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours without contradiction, and dance after the ſound of Flutes and other inſtruments when they make their prayers.</p>
                  <p>They have moreover another ſort of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Vagabonds through the world, cloathed like fools of that Country; they often go na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and cut their skin in many places, they are held to be holy perſons, and live by alms, which are never refuſed them; both the one and the other ſort of Religious are called <hi>Dervis,</hi> they are known by their habit, and can retire and marry when they pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>They deny Jeſus Chriſt to be God, or the Son of God; neither believe they in the holy Trinity: they ſay that Jeſus Chriſt was a great Prophet, born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> a Virgin both before and after her delivery; that he was conceived by divine inſpiration, or by a divine breath, without a father, as <hi>Adam</hi> was created without a mother; that he was not crucified, that God took him into heaven, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47532:62"/>that he ſhall come again on earth at the end of the world to confirm the Law of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> they likewiſe affirm, that the Jews thinking to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie Jeſus Chriſt, crucified a man among them that reſembled him.</p>
                  <p>They pray to God for the Dead,<note place="margin">A great queſtion among <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi>
                     </note> they invoke their Saints, of whom they have a large Legend, nevertheleſs they believe not Purgatory; and many among them imagine that the ſoul and body remain together in the grave until the day of Judgement.</p>
                  <p>They have <hi>Mecca</hi> and <hi>Medina,</hi> that are two Cities of <hi>Arabia,</hi> in great veneration becauſe <hi>Mahomet</hi> was born at <hi>Mecca,</hi> and buried at <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina:</hi> they make thither great pilgrimages, and believe that Land to be Holy: They bear like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſingular reſpect to the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for that it hath been the Birth-place, and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of many Prophets.</p>
                  <p>They uſe no Clocks; at the hour of their prayers their Prieſts aſcend the higheſt part of the Tower, that is in a corner of the Temple, and with a loud voice call the people to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſinging prayer, compoſed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> The Seraglio or Court of the Great SIGNOR.</head>
               <p>HAving before mentioned the place, to ſatisfie ſome Curioſities concerning this Emperors pleaſures, in which he ſatisfies himſelf with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, converſing with his Mutes and Buffones (for that it is not lawful for any body but the Vizier Baſſa's, and ſome few others to ſpeak to him) in the ſame ſignes and geſtures, and now and then riding, and ſhooting, and caſting a heavy Iron Mace, all which he is taught to do with great exactneſs; I will tranſiently ſpeak of that, then which nothing is more ſecret and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>viz.</hi> His Companying with women, the beautifulleſt thoſe parts of the world afford, the greateſt excellency and perfection whereof is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to conſiſt in great and broad eyes; the enjoyment of women ſo featured, being made a part of their Paradiſe in the World to come.</p>
               <p>They which are within the third gate, called the Kings gate, are about two thouſand perſons, men and women; whereof the women (old and young one with another; what with the Kings Concubines, old women, and women ſervants) may be about eleven or twelve hundred. Now thoſe which are kept up for their beauties, are all young Virgins, taken and ſtollen from forraign Nations; who after
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47532:63"/>they have been inſtructed in good behaviour, and can play upon Inſtruments, Sing, Dance, and ſew curiouſly; they are given to the Grand Signor as preſents of great value, and the number of theſe encreaſeth daily, as they are ſent and preſented by the Tartars, by the Baſhaws, and other great men, to the King and Queen. They do likewiſe ſometimes decreaſe, according as the Grand Signor ſhall think fit. For upon divers occaſions and accidents, he cauſeth many of them to be turned out of this Seraglio; and to be ſent into the Old Seraglio: which is alſo a very goodly and ſpacious place, of which hereafter I ſhall take occaſion to make mention.<note place="margin">Virgins made Turks and how.</note> Theſe Virgins immediately after their coming into the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio, are made Turks; which is done by uſing this Ceremony onely; to hold up their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger and ſay theſe words; <hi>law illawheh illaw Allawh, Mahummed reſoul Allawh.</hi> That is, there is no God but God alone, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> is the Meſſenger of God. As they are in age and diſpoſition (being proved and examined by an old woman called <hi>Kahiyah Cadun,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Kahiyah Cadun,</hi> the mother of the Maids</note> as we ſay, the Mother of the Maids) ſo they are placed in a room with the other of the ſame age, ſpirit, and inclination, to dwell and live together.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their manner of life.</note>Now in the womens lodging, they live juſt as Nuns do in great Nunneries, for theſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins have very large rooms to live in, and their Bed-Chambers will hold almoſt a hundred of them apiece. They ſleep upon Sofaes, which are
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47532:64"/>built long-wiſe on both ſides of the room, and a large ſpace left in the midſt to go to and fro a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Their Beds are very courſe and hard (for the Turks neither uſe Feather-beds nor Corded Bed-ſteads,) and by every ten Virgins their lies an old woman, and all the night long there are many lamps burning, ſo that one may ſee plainly throughout the whole room: which doth both keep the wenches from wantonneſs, and ſerve upon any occaſion which may happen in the night. Near unto the ſaid Bed-Chambers they have their Bagnos for their uſe at all times: with many Fountains, out of which they are ſerved with water, and above their Chambers there are divers rooms, where they ſit and ſew: and there they keep their Books, and Cheſts, in which they lay up their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel.</p>
               <p>They feed by whole <hi>Camaradaes,</hi> and are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and waited upon by other women: nor do they want any thing whatſoever that is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for them.</p>
               <p>There are other places likewiſe for them, where they go to School, to learn to ſpeak and read (if they will) the Turkiſh tongue, to ſew alſo, and to play on divers inſtruments, ſo they ſpend the day with their Miſtreſſes, who are all antient women: ſome hours notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being allowed them for their recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to walk in their Gardens, and uſe ſuch ſports as they familiarly exerciſe themſelves withall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:47532:64"/>The King doth not at all frequent or ſee theſe Virgins, unleſs it be at that inſtant when they are firſt preſented unto him; or elſe in caſe that he deſire one of them for his Bed-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or to make him ſome paſtime with muſick or other ſports: wherefore when he is prepared for a freſh Mate, he gives notice to the <hi>Kahiya Cadun</hi> of his purpoſe; who immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirs her ſelf like a crafty Baud, and chuſeth out ſuch as ſhe judgeth to be moſt amiable, and faireſt of all; and having placed them in good order in a room, in two ranks, like ſo many pictures, half on the one ſide, and half on the other, ſhe forthwith brings in the King,<note place="margin">The Kings co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to them.</note> who walking four or five times in the midſt of them, and having viewed them well, taketh good notice within himſelf of her that he beſt liketh, but ſays nothing; onely as he goeth out again, he throweth a Handkercheif into that Virgins hand; by which token ſhe knoweth that ſhe is to lik with him that night: ſo ſhe being (queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) exceeding joyful to become the object of ſo great a fortune, in being choſen out from among ſo many, to enjoy the ſociety of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, hath all the art that poſſible may be, ſhown upon her by the <hi>Cadun,</hi> in attiring, painting, and perſuming her; and at night ſhe is brought to ſleep with the Grand Signior in the womans lodgings, where there are Chambers ſet apart for that buſineſs onely. And being in bed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they have two great wax-lights burning by them all night; one at the beds feet, and the other by the door: beſides there are
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:47532:65"/>appointed (by the <hi>Cadun</hi>) divers old Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more women, to watch by turns that night in the Chamber, by two at a time; one of them to ſit by the light at the beds feet, and the other by the door, and when they will they change, and other two ſupply their rooms, without making the leaſt noiſe imaginable, ſo that the King is not any whit diſturbed. Now in the morning when his Highneſs riſeth (for he riſeth firſt) he changeth all his apparel from top to toe, leaving thoſe which he wore, to her that he lay withal, and all the money that was in his pockets, were it never ſo much; and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth to his own lodings; from whence alſo he ſendeth her immediately a preſent of jewels, money, and veſts of great value, agreeable to the ſatisfaction and content which he received from her that night. In the ſame manner he deals with all ſuch as he maketh uſe of in that kind; but with ſome he continueth longer then with other ſome, and enlargeth his bounty far more towards ſome then others; according as his humour, and affection to them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth, by their fulfilling his luſtful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
               <p>And if it ſo fall out, that any one of them doth conceive by him, and bring forth his firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten child: then ſhe is called by the name of Sultana Queen:<note place="margin">Sultana Queen.</note> and if it be a Son, ſhe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and eſtabliſhed by great feaſts, and ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and forthwith hath a dwelling aſſigned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her a part, of many ſtately rooms well furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and many ſervants to attend upon her.</p>

               <p>THe Fabricks of their Churches are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently large and ſumptuous, and called by the name of <hi>Meſchites:</hi> in which I never could perceive any ſort of fancies or imageries (for Idolatry is held by them the worſt of abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) but only theſe, or one of theſe inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions following, in the Arabick Language, <hi>There is no God but one, and</hi> Mahomet <hi>his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;</hi> or, <hi>One Creator and Prophets equal:</hi> or, <hi>None is ſtrong as God.</hi> Then there is ſeen a great abundance of burning Lamps, the whole Church whited, the Pavement covered with Mattreſſes, and on them the Ornaments of Tapeſtries. Near the Church, is erected a Tower of great height, to the top whereof the Prieſt aſcends before the time of Prayers, and with a loud voice, his earr ſtopped with his fingers, he thrice pro-proclaims theſe words; <hi>God, True, One:</hi> which Clamour or Out-cry (for they have no Bells) being heard, the Nobility, and all unbuſied perſons, repair to Church, as bound to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. Afterwards the ſaid Prieſt deſcending, prayes with them; (and then they turn their faces towards <hi>Mecca:</hi>) And this he is tyed to do by his Office, five times day and night. But whoſoever cometh to theſe Prayers, muſt waſh his hands, his feet and privities, and his head thrice ſprinkled with water: and theſe words
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47532:71"/>pronounced, <hi>Glory to my God;</hi> Then, their ſhooes put off, and left at the Church-door, they enter in, ſome bare-footed, others having new ſhooes or ſocks, and ſo tenderly touch the ground. Women come not into Churches, as being not excis'd, and for fear of diſturbing mens devotions, but meet apart in ſevered pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, altogether ſhut off from eyes and ears of men; and more ſeldom frequent their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, except in time of Paſſeover or Eaſter, and on Fridays; which dayes from <hi>Mahomets</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, for diſtinction and imitation, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt reſpect as much as Jews their Sabbaths, or Chriſtians the Lords day. They pray from nine a clock at night till twelve; and in their praying, their bodies are ever in great motion and agitation; wherewith they marvellouſly afflict themſelves with loud cryings and fierce ejaculations; ſo as oftentimes their ſtrengths and ſpirits failing, they ſink unto the ground; and if it happen any of them conceive her ſelf with child, ſhe then aſſures her ſelf that pregnancy proceeds from the favour of the Holy Spirit; and when delivered, the Infants born are called, <hi>Sons, or Souls of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> This hath been related to me from their Hand-maids; for I, nor ever any man elſe were ever preſent at that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle. At mens devotions I have been often preſent with my Maſter; whoſe cuſtoms are in manner following: in their prayers they ne're take off (their Turbants) coverings of their heads, but with the tops of their fingers gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch them, in token of taking them off;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:47532:71"/>they fall upon their knees and often kiſs the ground: they hold it for great wickedneſs, to have a Chriſtian preſent at their myſteries; for they believe their Churches (as they ſay) to be polluted by men unwaſhed; and that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians uſe no ſuch Lavatories. Every Church in Turkie hath a peculiar place for Baths and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, with lodings for a Prieſt. Now here the Prieſt aſcends his Pulpit (reads a piece of the Alcoran, and ſometimes expounds it) and there preaches about two hours; his Sermon ended, two boys come up to him, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their prayers ſinging with reſponſals; which Songs being ended, the Prieſt with the whole People in a low voice, beating upon their ſides, repeat theſe words, <hi>There is but one God;</hi> which for the ſpace of half an hour they do, and ſo depart. But this manner of prayers and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of preaching and ſinging, are not done every day, unleſs in time of Lent, Feſtivals, ſome Sundays; and moſt obſerve the Fridays for religious worſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of their Lent.</note>They keep their Lent by faſting one month and one week every Year; but not always the ſame: for if this Year they faſt out <hi>January,</hi> the next they faſt out <hi>February,</hi> and keep on that courſe; ſo as in twelve Years ſpace, they dedicate to God (in lieu of tenths) one Year and twelve Weeks. Travellers and ſick perſons are excuſed from preſent faſtings; but are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to ſupply it, by faſting ſo many daies at other times. When they faſt, all that Day they taſte nothing, not ſo much as bread or water;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47532:72"/>then the Stars appearing, it is lawful for them to eat of all things which are not ſtrangled, or Hogs-fleſh, which they eſteem as Carrion, moſt unclean. Their Lent being paſt, they obſerve <hi>Eaſter</hi> for three days, with great ſolemnity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing the nails of their Feet and Fingers with an Oyl which they call <hi>Chna,</hi> which makes thoſe nails to ſhine like Gold; and with the ſame, they ſometimes ſtain or colour the hoofs and tails of Horſes. This Tincture holds very long, and can hardly be wiped away: ſo as until new nails thruſt out the old, they ſtill retain that dye; but nails of the hand, by frequent waſhing, abate in time. Women do not only anoint the nails, but their whole Hands and Feet alſo with that Oyl.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of their Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note>They Circumciſe not on the eighth day as the <hi>Jews</hi> do, but when the new-born arrive at the age of ſeven or eight years, and be of perfect ſpeech: the myſterie whereof, is from the words of confeſſion required before Circumciſion, which are ſome of thoſe ſentences afore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in their Churches, which they repeat, and give aſſent thereto, by holding up the Thumb of the right hand. The Youth is not for this myſterie brought unto their Church, but is circumciſed in his Parents houſe. I have been often preſent at this ſolemnity, which is performed in manner following: firſt, the friends are all invited to a feaſt, ſufficiently furniſhed with all ſorts of delicate fleſh, lawful for them to eat; and almoſt every where, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the wealthier ſort, an Or is killed,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47532:72"/>bowelled and flayed; in the body whereof, they include a Sheep; and in that Sheep, a Hen; and in her, an Egge; all which are entirely roaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, for the ſolemnity and ſplendor of that day. Then in their Feaſt and time of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the Boy that is to be circumciſed, is brought to a Phyſitian skilful in that Art, who fixing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a pair of pinchers the fore-skin of his privie Member, to prevent all fear in the Boy, he telleth him that the next day he will circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe him, and ſo departs; but preſently ſeigning to have omitted ſomething appertaining to this preparation, on a ſudden he cutteth off the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin, applying thereunto a little ſalt and bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bace; and then he is called a Muſſelman, that is, one circumciſed. Yet their Names are given the day of their Nativity, not Circumciſion. After continuance of this Feaſt for three dayes, the Boy with great pomp and ſolemnity is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied to the Baths; and being returned to his Houſe, he is brought before the Gueſts, and by them preſented with gifts prepared for him; ſome give Silver, Silken Veſtments; ſome Silver Cups; others Money, and ſometimes Horſe. Women preſent him likewiſe, ſome with Shirts, Handkerchiefs, and ſuch like, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeveral pleaſures and abilities of the Gueſts. Women are not circumciſed, only they confeſs the aforeſaid words, and ſo made Muſſelmen. And if any Chriſtian voluntarily confeſs a Faith in <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and ſuffers circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, (which often happens by the heavy yoke and burden of their Tribute) this Man is led
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47532:73"/>through all the Streets and open places of the City, to the great joy and honour of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with acclamations: him alſo they preſent with gifts, and after free him from all Tribute. For covetouſneſs of this profit, many <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Albanes</hi> become circumciſed. But if any be forced thereto, as he that ſhall ſtrike or otherwiſe diſgrace a Muſſelman, or blaſpheme <hi>Mahomet,</hi> (as it befel a certain <hi>Grecian Biſhop</hi> which I did ſee) that man is circumciſed, and hath nothing preſented to him, yet ſhall be freed from Tribute, as others circumciſed.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Of their Prieſts.</note>Their great Mufty (as the Pope among Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks) cannot erre, and is the higheſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of all Religious and Lay Perſons: an Officer of great power and truſt: his concluſions and ſentences in State and Church-affairs, are irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable; and his perſon held in moſt eſteem and reverence next the Emperour: his habit moſt in green, being <hi>Mahomets</hi> colour. There is ſmall difference between their other Prieſts and Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, nor much from the Governours of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies (ſuch as our Biſhops are) neither is much learning required from them: it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient if they can read the <hi>ALCORAN</hi> and <hi>Muſaph;</hi> yet they that can interpret on the Text, are eſteemed moſt Learned, becauſe the Traditions of <hi>Mahomet</hi> are written in the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick,</hi> not vulgar Turkiſh Character; and they hold it moſt deteſtable, to have them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted in the vulgar Language. Theſe Prieſts and Governous are elected by the People; but their rewards and ſtipends for their labours, are
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47532:73"/>paid by the King. They have Wives, and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits like Seculars: and if their ſtipends be not ſufficient to mantain the number of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they otherwiſe ſupply themſelves by Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrafts &amp; Trades, or what elſe befits a free-man; as teaching Schools, tranſcribing Books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ne'er could ſee amongſt them any Printers; but Paper is there very well made.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of their Monks.</note>They have likewiſe Monks of ſeveral Orders; but chiefly of theſe three: the firſt have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in any thing; they go almoſt wholly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſaving their privities covered with a Sheeps skin, and in cold weather they uſe the like to cover their backs, their ſides, their feet and hands are never covered. They beg alms as well of Chriſtians as Turks; and, <hi>For God's ſake.</hi> Theſe Monks having eaten an Herb called <hi>Maſlach,</hi> are poſſeſt with a kind of fury and madneſs; they cut and wound their breaſts croſs and overthwart, and ſo their arms, diſſembling all trouble or pain; then clap on their heads, hands and breaſts, the ſpunge or muſhrooms of old Trees light burning, and not remove them till they are reduced to aſhes. Another Order I have ſeen, who go with their privy part bor'd thorow, and a Ring included therein of the weight of three pound; and this to preſerve chaſtity. The third Order is rarely ſeen abroad; but remain both day and night in Churches, where within ſome little Angles they have ſmall Cabins, no ſhooes, veſtments, or coverings of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47532:74"/>the had, wearing nothing but one ſhirt: their exerciſe is faſting and prayers, that God would reveal things future to them. With this ſort of Monks, the King of Turks uſually conſults, when he intends a motion on expedition to War.</p>
               <p>They give ſo much reſpect to <hi>Mahomets</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and Statutes,<note place="margin">Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</note> that not onely they never blaſpheme God or his Prophet; (which amongſt us ſometimes happens) but if they find the leaſt leaf or ſcrowl thereof, lying on the ground, they take it up and often kiſs it, and place it on ſome ſhelves or chinks of walls; affirming it a ſin, to ſuffer that wherein the Name of God, and Laws of <hi>Mahomet</hi> are written, to be trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under foot. And no man dares to ſell the Alcoran, and other writings of their Law, to any Chriſtian, or any other differing in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Faith with them, leſt they ſhould be trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den on, or touched with unclean hands: and whoſoever ſhould ſo do, is ſeverely puniſhed. And in this regard they may be ſtiled far more reverent then Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>They have places for Inſtruction, and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers both of Men and Women:<note place="margin">Of their Schools.</note> in ſeveral Towns, Men the Boys, and Women the Girls, ſome teach Aſtronomy, Phyſick; and ſome the Art of Poetry; which when they do, they ſpeak out with loud voice; and moving their hands unto their ſides, they pronounce their meanings. They underſtand no artificial Muſick, but frame Verſes to certain Rules, which conſiſt of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſyllables. The hotneſs of the Clymate, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47532:74"/>often ſickneſſes, makes moſt inclined to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, wherein they have ſome ſmall knowledge. They learn Aſtronomy, to be thought able to tell fortunes. Printing is ſupplied by a number of writing Prieſts: and perhaps neglected (as all learning is) to maintain the peoples ignorance, and keep them off from ſearch into the groſs ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities of their conſtrained Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their marriages</note>They marry without Vows or Oaths, take Wives without portions, and for the moſt part buy them, contrary to the Roman cuſtom, where the Son in-law was bought with Money to take a Daughter. This married Woman car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries nothing with her for uſe or ornament, which ſhe is not forced to redeem or purchaſe from her Parents. Evil manners or ſterility, are cauſes of Divorces: for which there is a peculiar Judge. They permit their bond-men or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed ſervants to marry; but the iſſue of them are all born ſlaves. The Alcoran perſwadeth marriage as pleaſing God and Man; and it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows plurality of Wives and Concubine, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as a Man pleaſeth. The Turk amongſt his (whereof he hath above five hundred in his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio's) nameth her for his Wife or Sultana, by whom he hath his firſt-begotten Son. All their Wives are uſed with equality of reſpect, in diet, cloaths, returns, and what concerns them; and are moſt obedient to their Husbands. They nurſe their own Children, and bear them on their Shoulders, not in their Arms: no men, but Eunuchs are ſuffered to be with them, not their own Sons, if above twelve years of age:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:47532:75"/>they never go abroad, but accompanied with onely Women.</p>
               <p>Pilgrims of ſeveral Nations travel to viſit ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly places,<note place="margin">Of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note> which the Turk poſſeſſeth; as <hi>Mecca</hi> and <hi>Medinum,</hi> (as Chriſtians, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) where they ſay <hi>Mahomet</hi> was buried: but this is done as well for gain and profit, as for devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Religions ſake. And there having ſeen a gilded Shoo hanging from the roof of the Church, and bought ſuch fine linnen and cloth as they pleaſe, they return home with great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; ſome carrying about the ſtreets wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, from thence in glaſes for devotion ſake, and freely give it to any that are thirſty; others do the like for profit. And if any one of them hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to die in this Pilgrimage; by what occaſion ſoever, although he ne're arrive near <hi>Mecca,</hi> yet he hath the eſtimation, and ſhall be placed in the rank of Pilgrims.</p>
               <p>I know not whether I ſhould call them Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or rather Monſtrous Toys,<note place="margin">Miracles done by <hi>Mahomet</hi> at <hi>Mecca,</hi> which they ſay he ſtill doth in theſe times.</note> written in their Book called <hi>Mehemidine,</hi> wherein they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that when <hi>Mecca</hi> was a building, God by the prayers of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> commanded divers mountains to bring their ſtone to the Fabrick of that Church, every Hill his tenth: and when divers Mountains had brought their portions, and <hi>Mecea</hi> built and perfectly compleated, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Hill called <hi>Araphat,</hi> and ſome other more remote, coming thither with their tenths ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too late, and finding <hi>Mecca</hi> built, and no uſe of their ſtones, they begun moſt bitterly to weep; which when <hi>Mahomet</hi> perceived Hills ſo
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:47532:75"/>diſtreſſed, and underſtood the cauſe, he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, <hi>Be of good chear, weep not, but ſtore your tenths up in a place which I ſhall ſhew you; and whoſoever ſhall not pray upon your ſtones, his pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage ſhall be unprofitable and unaccepted.</hi> And after ſo doing, <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſtruck the ſtones with his foot, and there iſſued out Water, not uſeful to drink; and impoſed a name, and called it, <hi>A Water of Purification,</hi> whereof every Pilgrim carrieth at his return, ſome portions thereof in veſſels; and when ever any die, the veſtures wherewith the body is to be covered, are ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with this water, for remiſſion of their ſins. And they further affirm, That no man can come to <hi>Mecca,</hi> whoſe viſit is not known to <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> who reveals the perſons to the Keepers there (all Eunuchs:) and if a Pilgrim come, a Raviſher, or wicked Man, a Chriſtian or any of Religion different from theirs; theſe ſaid Keepers forbid him entrance into <hi>Mecca.</hi> But the body of <hi>Mahomet</hi> is not there, as ſome affirm, but onely an imaginary form in the Wall of the Church, expreſſing the lineament of a body, which is often kiſſed; and ſo they return home again. Such lying follies, for miracles, theſe Infidels are poſſeſſed with, concerning <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and divers others, ſo ridiculous, as I omit for modeſties ſake: yet muſt adviſe the Reader, if he pleaſe, to interrogate any Turk therein, and he will finde I have ſpoke nothing but meer Truth.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Of their Sacrifice.</note>Their offerings or oblations are for the moſt part upon promiſe or vows, in ſickneſſes or other dangers; and then they kill an Ox or a Sheep, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their abilities, and promiſe to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it in ſome certain place. This Offering is not burnt, or placed on an Altar, after the cuſtom of the <hi>Jews;</hi> but the Beaſt being killed, the skin, head &amp; feet, and a fourth part of the fleſh, is given to the Prieſt; another part, to the poor; a third, to neighbours; and the remainder they keep for themſelves and friends to rejoyce withal. Neither are they tyed to perform theſe vows, unleſs they eſcape the diſeaſe or danger for which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them: all things with them being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional; <hi>I give you, if you give me.</hi> And the like is obſerved by the <hi>Greeks, Armenians,</hi> and other Aſiatick people, even of the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p>If any of their Muſſelmen make a Will, their Legacies are given before Friends or Neighbors;<note place="margin">Of their Wills and Legacies.</note> and they are commonly for cutting Water-cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for conveying Springs from ſome remote places to Hoſpitals, Churches, or dry habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and that for Piety ſake, &amp; their ſouls benefit.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47532:76"/>Others give money to free bond-men out of thraldom.

               <p>AFter I had travelled with much labour and many dangers the better parts of the world, and ſeen many pleaſant Towns and Countries, as <hi>Socrates, Plato</hi> and other Philoſophers had diligently done; at length I arrived at the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous City of <hi>Hungary, Varadinum,</hi> where by chance I met one <hi>Dervis Gſielebi,</hi> a skilful man in the Laws of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> who having diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his buſineſs with the Governour, he very much deſired conference with ſome Chriſtian about Religion on either ſide. This motion of his being publiſhed by an Interpreter, and none for divers dayes appearing to encounter him, in defence of the Chriſtian cauſe, though many Religious perſons were in that Town, (ſtruck mute and ſpeechleſs at the courage of one Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick

This I perceiving, and grieving in my ſpirit, that in ſuch plenty of Clerks and learned men, none was ſo well armed with Truth as durſt (though by Interpreters) reprove the inſolence of ſuch an Heathen; and fearing that ſo wicked and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable a ſilence, in ſo good a cauſe, with ſo bad a man, would betray the truth, and render our Saviour Jeſus Chriſts Opinion with him more ignominious; I my ſelf, though never called to Eccleſiaſtical Function, undertook the charge of arguing this point of Piety with him; and ſo a prefixed day was agreed between us; when multitudes of people of each Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on came as Spectators of the event. The place was in a Monaſtery of <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> the day, <hi>Whitſon</hi>-Sunday, day of Pentecoſt; where he moved to me firſt this Queſtion: <hi>Where God had his being, before the Heavens and Earth, and therein all things elſe were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated?</hi> Which queſtion, though it ſeemed to me not much pertinent to our purpoſe, yet leſt he ſhould imagine us ignorant of our great Gods univerſal preſence, I ſaid, <hi>He then was in his own being.</hi> But when that ſeemed to him ſomewhat obſcure, and that he did not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently underſtand it, I then told him, <hi>He was where he now is.</hi> Which he underſtanding, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied in the general, and ſaid, <hi>Not ſo; but that be then was in a bright Cloud.</hi> Which, when he earneſtly affirmed, I quoted <hi>Geneſis;</hi> (for
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:47532:92"/>they alſo read the book of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets) and ſaid, <hi>If God were in a cloud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Foundation of Heaven and earth, then that Cloud muſt be created before them both:</hi> and upon further argument on this point, being at laſt convicted, he would diſpute no further in it; but gave me leave to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſome Queſtion to him; and for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of that days ſake, I thought fit to ſay ſomething thereof; and finding theſe words <hi>(In the name of God, his mercies, and the Spirit of them)</hi> in their <hi>Alcoran,</hi> in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Tongue and Character, I deſired him to read them: The myſtery of the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Which when he had conſidered, and wondred at, he ſaid, <hi>Chriſtian, from whence had you this? for in the beginning of all our actions, we</hi> Muſſelmen <hi>uſe theſe three words, and prefix them to every Chapter of our</hi> Alcoran; <hi>when we ſit down to eat, when we go to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, when we waſh our hands, or other parts of our bodies, theſe words we firſt pronounce; and theſe actions finiſhed, we ſprinkle our heads with water, and repeat theſe words; In the Name of God, his Mercies, and the Spirit of them.</hi> When thus he had confeſſed the Truth, I deſired to underſtand from him what he meant by the word <hi>Mercies:</hi> who Replied, <hi>He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it literally, without other ſignification.</hi> Then I applied my ſelf to the myſtical inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and divided it according to Truth into three perſons, <hi>the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and ſhewed them written in
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:47532:93"/>the <hi>Arabick</hi> tongue. And when he ſaw I had mentioned the Son of God, he queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>How God could have a Son? ſince accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Law, and Doctrine of</hi> Mahomet, <hi>God had neither Wife nor Child.</hi> To whom I anſwered, according to my weak under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and capacity; <hi>We Chriſtians call God the Father, for his Creatures ſake; being the firſt creating Cauſe, and ſole preſerver of all created, who was for ever in the ſame Eſſence he now is in, and will be for eternity; and is the firſt Perſon in the Trinity. We believe the Son</hi> (who by <hi>Mahomet</hi> in the <hi>Arabick</hi> phraſe is called <hi>Rahman,</hi> and ſignifieth <hi>Mercies,</hi> ſo changed by him) <hi>to be likewiſe God, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to fleſh</hi> (for God is a ſpirit) <hi>born of a Woman; but of the Eſſence and ſubſtance of God omnipotent, begotten by God the Father, and ſo took humane fleſh, by the Holy Virgin</hi> Mary; <hi>ſuffered for us, died, and was buried, and according to the ſaying of the Prophets, aroſe again the third day, and aſcended into Heaven, and ſitteth at the Right Hand of God the Father, there to judge the quick and the dead, to render immortal happineſs to thoſe that have faith in him, and to the unfaithful everlaſting puniſhment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I then preſented him a Crucifix, and ſaid, <hi>Behold this now, and ſee if</hi> Mahomet <hi>did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily call the Son of the Eternal God by the Name of Mercies, when with Armes thus ſtretched forth, he calls poor ſinners to his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47532:93"/>and are burthened with ſins, and I will refreſh you.</hi> And to render him more capable of the Trinity, I pointed to the Sun, ſaying, <hi>You have a fair ſimilitude here: As there is but one Sun, that hath Form, Heat, and Light; So there is but one God and Father, who hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>the Son, and the Holy Spirt, which you call</hi> Rucahim, <hi>conſiſting of three Perſon, equally of one ſubſtance, and from eternity coexiſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This compariſon wrought in him a belief in God the Father, his onely begotten Son, and the Holy Ghoſt; a Trinity in Unity. And when he had heard my weak diſcourſes of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt, he much admired; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>O God, O God; I nor any of our Sect, could ever imagine, you had ſuch good thoughts of God; for we conceive you live in darkneſs of underſtanding: but by your relation, it ſeems you have great apprehenſions of him; and believe God,</hi> Mahomet. I ſaid, <hi>what ſhall we do with the toys and dreams of</hi> Mahomet? <hi>for beſides Baptiſme and the myſtery of the Trinity, which were had from Chriſtians, we know the</hi> Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran <hi>contains naught that tends to truth.</hi> Then I alledged to him the fancies and ſilly trifles of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s two Angels, called <hi>Arot</hi> and <hi>Marot,</hi> whom <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſays, that God did ſend from Heaven to miniſter juſtice unto mortal men, commanding them to forbid drinking of wine, and unlawful mixtures with women, and to ſhew the way to Heaven to no man. Theſe
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:47532:94"/>Angles tranſgreſſing Divine Comandment, were defiled, deceived and made drunk by a Woman, and ſhewed to <hi>Mahomet</hi> the way to Heaven; whom, when God ſaw there, he asked the Angles ſtanding by, who it was that came in that ſhape thither? And the Angels tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him it was by the error of <hi>Arot</hi> and <hi>Marot;</hi> he turned the Woman into a Star, and ſent thoſe Angels chained into a Well, to be puniſhed everlaſtingly. Divers like ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous ſtories I related; As that of the Beaſt <hi>Baraile,</hi> who could ſpeak as a man, who carried <hi>Mahomet</hi> to Heaven, where him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſeth to have ſeen great Angels with many heads, and thoſe ſpeaking many lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages in divers tongues; which is ſufficiently fooliſh, and unworthy the name of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: but ſaid, I know not whether oppreſſed with Wine, in ſleep he dreamed to have ſeen ſuch miracles, or monſtroſities in his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations. And therefore when he inſerts ſuch follies in his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> he deſerves not the Title of a Prophet from any reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man.</p>
               <p>Having heard this, ſomewhat abaſhed, he aroſe, and would argue no further: but led me into the Temple, and ſhewed me certain Images car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in wood; and asked me, <hi>If we did worſhip thoſe ſimilitudes of men, or adore them;</hi> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>No, think not we worſhip the ſtone or tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber wherein theſe figures are engraved: they are uſed and reſpected onely as records and remembrances to mens minds of the paſſions and ſufferings of our
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:47532:94"/>Saviour Jeſus Chreſt, for the redemption of our tranſgreſſions; and we worſhip our true God in mind and ſpirit, remembred by that Crucifix; neither are you denyed the like remembrances of your great Princes and famous men, nor we of holy Saints; but 'tis to give God thanks for their examples of holineſs, and our prayers to imitate their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities and pieties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe diſcourſings, he ſpies ſome dogs walking in the Church, and doing ſomething againſt an Altar, (an evil cuſtom, and to be condemned by all) and asked, Whether it was lawful for Beaſts to enter our Churches? and bluſhing with ſhame, not knowing how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend this negligence of Chriſtian Paſtors, I told him, it was neither lawful nor ſeemly; and deſired him to conceive it a meer negligence of Officers.</p>
               <p>When he heard this, he commended it very much, and deſired me to inſtruct him in our Saviours Prayer, which I gave him afterward in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Dialect.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Turks</hi> are exceeding credulous, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, relying upon Dreams, Fortunes, Propheſies, Divinations and Deſtiny, and have eſpecial regard to the Enthuſiaſms and Freaks of whatſoever diſtracted or mad perſons, as taking them for Prophetical raptures, and as men taken up with admiration and extaſie of ſome divine and raviſhing objects; and therefore no wonder
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:47532:95"/>if they do with veneration receive thoſe Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of their Prieſts, voiced to be dictated by their great Prophet, or ſome other perſon emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for his great Piety and Holineſs.</p>
                  <p>Among the firſt rank of thoſe Predictions, is that of the return of their great Prophet, for which the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> who have long lookt for his coming, keep alwayes a horſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſadled with rich furniture, as priding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that the Miracle of the Converſion of the World ſhall be propagated upon that Horſe from their Country. To omit many more fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of this nature.</p>
                  <p>As to their temporal ſtate and Government, they have a Propheſie in which they are much diſconſolate, <hi>viz.</hi> That as a <hi>Mahomet</hi> won <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> ſo another Emperor of that Name ſhall loſe it to the Chriſtians, and that they ſhall then be brought to the utmoſt extremity; but their Prophet <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſhall appear to their deliverance.</p>
                  <p>They have another Propheſie relating to Chriſtendom, which is turned upon this hinge; They meaſure the continuance of their Empire by the diſcord betwixt the Princes of the belief of the Name of Jeſus, and they confeſs truly, that this diviſion is the only cauſe of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the which hath made them believe, that among Chriſtians, there was a bad Angel, enemy to peace, which they call <hi>the ſtrong or powerful Spirit,</hi> which kindling the fire of revenge and ambition in the hearts of great men, draws from their affections the good of their belief, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47532:95"/>them in perpetual diſcord; during the which, they promiſe unto themſelves a firm and an aſſured reign. So the Mufti, and the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmans praying on Friday in their Moſques, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their Prophet the circumſtance of this bad intelligence betwixt Chriſtian Princes, to the end they may enjoy the Empire which they have unjuſtly uſurped. Yet their Propheſies do not promiſe them a perpetual poſſeſſion; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold one tranſlated out of their language, which hath alwayes made them fear the union of the Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>That is to ſay,</p>
                  <q>Our Emperor ſhall come, he ſhall poſſeſs the Realm of an infidel Prince, he ſhall take the red Apple, and make it ſubject to his power: if at the ſeventh year of his command the Chriſtians ſword doth not advance, he ſhall rule unto the twelfth year, he ſhall build houſes, plant vines, compaſs in gardens with hedges, and beget children: but after the twelfth year that he hath held the red ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Chriſtians ſword ſhall appear and put the Turk to flight.</q>
                  <p>By the <hi>Infidel</hi> Prince they underſtand a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prince (for ſo they call them) and by the <hi>Red Apple</hi> an Imperial town ſtrong and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; in the which, and elſe where the Turks ſhall <hi>build houſes;</hi> that is to ſay, convert holy temples to the uſe of the Mahometan impiety: for by this word <hi>to build,</hi> they that have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented upon this propheſie, underſtand uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the houſe s of God: <hi>Plant vines,</hi> by theſe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:47532:96"/>words they ſignifie the extent of the Turkiſh Empire, and the ſetling of their colonies, as we ſee in Hungary and Tranſylvania: <hi>Compaſſing in gardens,</hi> that is to ſay, they ſhall fortifie the towns which they have taken from their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: <hi>Beget Children,</hi> extend the Mahometan Religion, far in the Chriſtians Countries. <hi>But after the twelfth year, &amp;c.</hi> within a certain time beſt known to God, his divine Majeſty, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eyes of his clemency upon the Chriſtians, will unite the wills of their Princes, kindle their affections with a holy zeal, and bleſſing their arms, will make them victorious over the Turk, whom he will baniſh out of the Eaſt, and chaſe into Scythia, from whence they came to be a ſcourge unto Chriſtendom.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> A brief View of the Tartars.</head>
               <p>HAving thus ſurveyed the Turkiſh Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it will be an acceptable endeavour I preſume to give the Reader a little diſcovery of the <hi>Tartar</hi> and his Concerns, which are linked and joyned by Religion and other compacts to the Grand Seigniors, becauſe this Nation hath been as yet much unknown to us.</p>
               <p>TARTARIA is bounded on the Eaſt, with <hi>China,</hi> the Oriental Ocean, and the ſtreights of <hi>Anian</hi> (if ſuch ſtreights there be) by which parted from <hi>America,</hi> on the Weſt with <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and <hi>Podolia,</hi> a Province of the Realm of <hi>Poland;</hi> on the North with the main <hi>Scythick</hi> or <hi>Frozen</hi> Ocean; and on the South part with part of <hi>China,</hi> from which ſeparated by a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wall; the River <hi>Oxus</hi> parting it from <hi>Bactria</hi> and <hi>Margiana,</hi> two <hi>Perſian</hi> Provinces; the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, which ſeparates it from <hi>Media,</hi> and <hi>Hyrcania;</hi> the <hi>Caucaſian</hi> mountains interpoſing betwixt it and <hi>Turcomania;</hi> and the <hi>Euxine,</hi> which divideth it from <hi>Anatolia</hi> and <hi>Thrace.</hi> So called from the <hi>Tartars,</hi> a puiſſant and mighty people, now poſſeſſed hereof.</p>
               <p>It containeth all thoſe great and ſpacious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, which the Ancients called <hi>Seres, Scythia extra Imaum, Scythia intra Imaum, Saca, Sogdia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> the greateſt part of <hi>Sarmatia Aſiatica,</hi> and part of <hi>Sarmatia Europaea;</hi> extending it ſelf
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:47532:97"/>the whole length of <hi>Aſia,</hi> from the River <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais,</hi> to the Eaſtern Ocean; taking in <hi>Taurica Cherſoneſus,</hi> and ſome other parts of Europe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. So that if we meaſure it by miles, it is ſaid to contain 5400 from Eaſt to Weſt, and 3600 from North to South; a greater quantity of ground then the Turkiſh Empire, but of leſs fertility and account.</p>
               <p>This extent in eaſier terms ſtretched from the uttermoſt bounds of <hi>Aſia</hi> to <hi>Armenia,</hi> and from <hi>Bengala</hi> to <hi>Volga,</hi> yea their incurſions pierced even to <hi>Nilus</hi> and <hi>Danubius.</hi> The <hi>Macedonian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Empires were never ſo large. But becauſe they were rather Runnagates then men of War, wanting politick Government, and Military Diſcipline, ſometime ruling one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, ſometime another; they rather wrought ſpoyl and terror to the conquered Nations, then fear of bondage and ſubjection, and at laſt ſeated themſelves beyond the mountain <hi>Caucaſus.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it became divided into many Principalities, yet ſo that the title and majeſty of the Empire remained always to the great <hi>Cham,</hi> who took the original of this name from the great <hi>Chingis,</hi> the founder of this Empire.</p>
               <p>But leaving the great <hi>Cham</hi> of theſe <hi>Tartars,</hi> the Succeſſors of <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> to remoter affairs, ſuppoſed by very learned men to be but an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Titulado, and the ſhadow of the <hi>ſhadow of ſpirits,</hi> as they call their Emperor; our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe obligeth us only to an account of the <hi>Crim</hi> or <hi>Praecopenſe Tartar,</hi> ſo called from <hi>Praecopia,</hi> a chief town thereof. This Tartary is bounded on
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:47532:97"/>the Eaſt with the River <hi>Tanais,</hi> now <hi>Don,</hi> on the Weſt with the River <hi>Nieper</hi> once called <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſthenes,</hi> by which it is parted from <hi>Podolia,</hi> on the North part with <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and on the South with ſome part of the Euxine Sea, by which lye the <hi>Circaſſians,</hi> a ſort of warlike Chriſtians, who ſell their children to Mahometans for to make Souldiers of them, ſuch as were the Mamalukes, ſuch now ſome of the Janizaries, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian ſtanding Army.</p>
               <p>Theſe Tartars are good Souldiers for the moſt part (as their frequent irruptions into Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope do ſadly manifeſt) eſpecially at Bows and Arrows, which they uſe as dextrouſly as the <hi>Parthians;</hi> of late years they have been trained up to the Harquebuze, and the handling of a Scimetar. They are not to be vanquiſhed but by death, as reſolute againſt captivity, the miſery whereof they know from their own cruelties, yet at home are they more civil to Chriſtians then abroad, for they have ſome honourable thoughts of our Saviour, more then other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans, which hath invited many <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Armenians</hi> to co-habit with them.</p>
               <p>As to their modern Hiſtory, and for what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to our purpoſe, we muſt retroſpect to the reign of <hi>Mahomet</hi> the firſt, the Turkiſh Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror when they grew at laſt of ſo great Power, by conquering the <hi>Aſiatick Tartars,</hi> which lay neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to them, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Great thought fit to keep them down before grown too ſtrong for him: and therefore under colour of taking in the City of <hi>Capha,</hi> then poſſeſſed by the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:47532:98"/>made himſelf Maſter of the greateſt part of the <hi>Taurican Cherſoneſe,</hi> and the port of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais;</hi> thereby commanding both <hi>Moe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tis</hi> and the Euxine Sea.</p>
               <p>In the time of <hi>Selymus</hi> the firſt, who had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the daughter of this <hi>Crim-Tartar</hi> (for ſo they called him) and was aided by him with an Army of fifteen thouſand men againſt his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; The Turks and theſe Tartarians grew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a League. The chief conditions of it were, that the Tartar ſhould aid the Turk upon all occaſions, with ſixty thouſand Horſe, that they ſhould not make war with any of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, (except the Muſcovite) without leave of the Turk; that they ſhall pay yearly to the Grand Seignior in the way of Tribute, three hundred Chriſtians; that the new <hi>Cham,</hi> upon the death or depoſition of his Predeceſſor, ſhall receive from the Great Turk a Royal Banner, in token of his Confirmation in that eſtate, that in reward of theſe ſervices, the Crim Tartar ſhall have yearly from the Grand Seignior, five thouſand five hundred Ducats, in the way of penſion; and ſucceed finally in the Turkiſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, if the male iſſue of the houſe of <hi>Ottoman</hi> ſhould chance to fail. According unto this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Tartars have been aiding to the Turks from time to time, againſt the <hi>Perſians, Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Hungarians, Moldavians,</hi> and indeed whom not; and that with great and puiſſant Armies; the Great <hi>Cham</hi> ſometimes arming 150000. of his own Subjects (leaving but one man in an houſe to attend their Cattel;) and ſometimes
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:47532:98"/>adding five thouſand <hi>Circaſſians;</hi> and others of the <hi>Aſian Tartars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing ſo punctual is the Turk, on his part to perform the contract; who not content to have the Tartar for his friend, or at the worſt his Homager, hath of late times attempted to make him his ſlave or vaſſal. For <hi>Amurath</hi> the third, quarrelling <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Crim-Tartar for a deſign to intercept <hi>Oſman Baſſa,</hi> in his way from <hi>Perſia</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> authorized the ſame <hi>Oſman</hi> to war upon him: by whom the poor <hi>Crim</hi> and his two Sons, betrayed by ſome of his own Councellors (corrupted with Turkiſh gold) were ſtrangled with a Bow-ſtring; <hi>Iſlan</hi> a brother of the <hi>Crims,</hi> firſt ſworn a Vaſſal to the <hi>Turk,</hi> put into the place, and over him a <hi>Turkiſh Beglerbeg</hi> or <hi>Baſſa,</hi> to command in chief. What hopes he hath of ſucceeding in the <hi>Turkiſh Empire,</hi> if (poſſible) the houſe of <hi>Ottoman</hi> ſhould fail are doubtful, for that the Baſhaws will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alter the ſtate or provide for themſelves, like <hi>Alexanders</hi> Lieutenants, or ſet one of their number, or a counterfeit Brother or Uncle of the laſt Emperor, whom they will govern as they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>What the Revenue of this Prince is, it is hard to ſay: his ſubjects have little money, and live moſt upon the bartery of their Cattel. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what he hath in lands or Cuſtoms, and the 5500 <hi>Ducats</hi> yearly from the Turk, he hath the tenth of all the ſpoyls which are got in the Wars, and a <hi>Checkine</hi> for every Captive, for ſome, two or three, (whoſoever taketh them) according unto their eſtates.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:47532:99"/>As them by the Turk, (who doth ſometime eſpouſe his quarrels;) by whoſe aſſiſtance they have brought the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> to ſome extremities.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> The Character of <hi>Tamerlane</hi> the Great.</head>
               <p>THis renowned Prince, the glory of his age for warlike atchievements, was born at <hi>Samarcand,</hi> the chief City of the Zagalaian Tartars, his Father was called <hi>Zain-Cham</hi> or <hi>Og,</hi> Prince of thoſe people, who ſpending his time in peace, contenting himſelf to live upon the profit of his flocks of Sheep and Herds of Cattel, which then and alſo now are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Revenues of the Tartar Kings and Princes; gave occaſion to ſome, ignorant of the manner and cuſtom of thoſe northern Nations and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to reckon them all for Shepherds and Herdſmen, and ſo have reported this great Prince to be a Shepherd or Herdſmans Son; meaſuring his Nobility by the rudeneſs of his people, and not by the honour of his Family and heroical vertues, ſuch as hardly to be paralleled in that or former ages.</p>
               <p>Scarce had he attained to 15. years of age when his Father dyed, leaving unto him the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Kingdom, and for his counſel in the ſame, he commended to him two of his moſt truſty and faithful Servants, <hi>viz. Odmard</hi> &amp; <hi>Aly,</hi> whom he dearly loved whilſt they lived,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47532:99"/>being much ruled by their directions, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honoured the remembrance of them being dead, as perſons from whom he had received his rudiments for his future Government. He was a man of greater ſtrength then ſtature, and of far greater courage then ſtrength; to which his policy being added, made him a moſt renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and fortunate Warior. In his eyes ſate ſuch a rare Majeſty, as a man could hardly endure to behold them without cloſing his own; from whence darted ſuch radiant beams, that many in talking with him were ſtricken dumb; which occaſioned him many times with a beſeeming modeſty to forbear looking too earneſtly on thoſe that talked or diſcourſed with him. He was ſomewhat narrow in the ſhoulders, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes well limbed; his viſage was amiable, and of an excellent proportion, but little hair on his chin; the hair of his head long and curled, quite contrary to the manner of the Tartars, who ſhave and cover their heads, whereas he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe did wear it long, in obedience to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as he gave it out) who commanded him ſo to wear it in token of his diſcent, ſhe pretending to come of the race of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> which cauſed him to be the more reſpected of his men of War, they believing that in thoſe hairs there was ſome rare vertue, or rather fatal deſtiny; an ancient practiſe of many eminent Commanders, to fill the heads of their Souldiers with ſome ſtrange opinion conceived of them, thereby to receive the greater honour, as if in them were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then ordinary men. Thus <hi>Numa
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:47532:100"/>Pompilius</hi> feigned to have received his Laws from the Goddeſs <hi>Egeria,</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor bewitched the people with a Pigeon which he had taught to feed at his ear, whom he perſwaded to be the holy Ghoſt, which brought him Revelations out of Heaven.</p>
               <p>That he was of a valiant courage from his youth, his actions do declare, not dreading any danger when occaſion did require it, having fortune alwayes attending on him as his hand-maid. His firſt endeavours were crowned with admirable ſucceſs, viz. againſt the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who having ſpoyled a City which had put it ſelf under his protection, and alſo entered into his Country; he thereupon met them with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, gave them battel, and ſlew of them five and twenty thouſand foot-men, and between fifteen and ſixteen thouſand horſe-men, with the loſs of ſcarce eight thouſand horſe-men, and four thouſand foot-men of his own: yet was he far from exulting in this victory, that behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many thouſand dead bodies on the ground, he fell on weeping at the condition of ſuch as commanded over great Armies, applauding a quiet courſe of life for the moſt happy, and accounting the other moſt unhappy, which by the deſtruction of their own kind, ſought to purchaſe to themſelves vain glory.</p>
               <p>He was by nature a great chaſtiſer of proud and inſolent perſons, yet withal ſo juſt that he would not be moved to undertake any thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſhly or unadviſedly, but would firſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the truth of the ſame; witneſs the time
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:47532:100"/>when the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Princes of <hi>Aſia</hi> oppreſſed by <hi>Bajazet,</hi> ſued unto him for aid, to whom he gave this anſwer, <hi>I can hardly believe</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that ſo great and religious a Prince as</hi> Bajazet, <hi>would without juſt and ſufficient cauſe offer ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence as you may complain of, eſpecially unto you his neighbour Princes, and of the ſame Religion with himſelf; nevertheleſs I will ſend an Ambaſſador to him, to underſtand more of him &amp; his proceedings, till then I ſhall not reſolve any thing, and therefore until ſuch time you muſt reſt your ſelves content.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he ſent an Ambaſſador unto him, with many rich gifts and preſents, courteouſly requeſting him the rather for his ſake, to deal kindly with thoſe Mahometan Princes; but <hi>Bajazet</hi> being a Prince of a proud ſpirit, reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his meſſage with great ſcorn, willing the Ambaſſador to bid his Maſter to meddle with his own matters, and to preſcribe Laws to his own Subjects; adding thereunto many other words, full of great diſpight and diſdain, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him the Husband of a Whore if he met him not in the field: So that <hi>Tamerlane</hi> could do no leſs in juſtice and honour then war againſt him, and having overthrown him to puniſh his haughtineſs, he ſhackled him in fetters of gold, and ſo ſhut him up in an iron Cage, made like a grate, in ſuch ſort, as that he might be ſeen on every ſide, carrying him up and down with him as he paſſed thorough <hi>Aſia;</hi> which, though ſome may conſtrue as an action of cruelty, yet he himſelf ſaid, <hi>That he did not uſe that rigour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him as King, but rather did puniſh him as
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47532:101"/>a proud ambitious Tyrant, polluted with the blood of his own Brother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as he was dreadful and terrible to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſo none were more kind or courteous to his friends: the ſervice of his ſervant he never forgot, neither left the ſame long unreawarded, being therefore ſo mindful that he needed not by them or others on their behalf, to be put in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance thereof, having for that purpoſe a Catalogue always by him, both of their names and good deſerts, which every day he did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe like another <hi>Titus Veſpatian,</hi> ſaying, he <hi>had loſt that day wherein he had not done ſome good,</hi> yet never beſtowing his preferment on ſuch as were undeſerving, or ambitiouſly ſought after the ſame, deeming them altogether unworthy; but upon ſuch whoſe modeſty and deſert he took ſpecial notice of, that they were worthy of ſuch favours, ſo tempering the ſeverity of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, with the greatneſs of his bounty, that it is dubious whether he were of his Nobility, or men of War, for the one more feared, or for the other beloved, both the great ſtaies of Princes States; fear keeping the obſtinate in obedience, and love the dutiful in devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Although by Religion he was a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> yet would he diſlike no man for his Religion whatſoever, ſo that he did worſhip but one onely God; creator of Heaven and Earth, and all that therein is: he himſelf beleiving that God was one in eſſence, and in himſelf immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, without change or diverſity, and yet for
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:47532:101"/>the manifeſting of his omnipotency and power, he created in the world ſundry kinds of people, differing both in nature, manners, and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet all framed to the Image of himſelf; ſo in like manner was he contented of his Subjects to be diverſly ſerved, according to the diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their natures and manners, ſo they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped no ſtrange Gods; which was the cauſe that he permitted the exerciſe of all Religions in thoſe Countries ſubject to his obedience, were they not meer Atheiſts or Idolaters.</p>
               <p>His Army though very great, was like unto a well governed City, in paſſing thorough any Country with his Souldiers, he took ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that none of the people whereby he paſſed, were by them any thing injured, inſomuch that if a Souldier had but taken an Apple, or other thing of like value from any man, he died therefore, ſo ſevere were his commands. It is reported that one of his Souldiers having taken a little milk from a Country woman, and ſhe complaining thereof, he commanded the ſaid Souldier to be preſently killed, and his ſtomach to be ript, where the milk being found, he ſatisfied the woman and ſo ſent her away, who doubtleſs elſe had died for her falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, had it not ſo appeared. This ſeverity (with ſome other of the like nature) was very conducible to the preſervation of his Army, which was ſo great, that it was thought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible to have found ſufficient victuals for the releif thereof; but by his ſevere puniſhment of diſorders, both Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47532:102"/>and Merchants from far Countries, reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their Commodities and Merchandiſe to his Camp, without fear from every place, for which they received preſent mony, and ſo in ſafety again departed.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Cities that yeilded to him he favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly received, but the other that refuſed to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to his obedience, he uſed with all extremity. He uſed often to ſay, that a ſmall number well conducted, did many times carry away the victory from the confuſed multitude. He rather ſought to maintain his Army upon the ſpoile of his enemy, though with ſome hazard, then upon his Friends and Allies, and when he ſent out any part of his vaſt Army, for the taking of any place, he would command them on pain of his diſpleaſure, ſo to behave themſelves, that at his comming he might either finde the City taken, or the Gates ſhut againſt him, which they ſeldom failed for to do, for he had his men at ſo great command, that no danger unto them was more dreadful then his diſpleaſure, nor did he puniſh any thing ſo ſeverely as cowardiſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that if in his diſport of Hunting the wild Beaſt, any one did for fear give way either to a Bear or Lyon, and ſlew him not, was ſure therefore to die himſelf, and to turn his back upon the enemy was no leſs dangerous, then to run upon his own death.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THis famous and renowned Champion, was ſon to <hi>John Caſtriot,</hi> who reigned in <hi>Epirus</hi> in the time of <hi>Amurath</hi> the fixth King of the Turks, about the year of our Lord 1422. His father not being able to withſtand the growing fortunes of that ambitious Tyrant, delivered him with his three brothers as hoſtages to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain peace, whom the perfidious <hi>Amurath</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to entreat well and honourably, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the death of their Father poyſoned three of them, only this <hi>George Caſtriot</hi> (for ſo was his name) whom the Tyrant entirely loved, eſcaped death. For his excellent feature and pregnant wit, he was by the Turks named <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> or Lord <hi>Alexander,</hi> and in his youth ſhewed many tokens what a rare Scholar he would prove in the School of <hi>Mars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was of a very noble generous mind, affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liberty, and therefore a great enemy to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants; but having to deal with potent adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he was forced to add policy to his ſtrength, and ſo piece out the Lions skin with the Foxes tail; for it was almoſt a miracle, that in little more then a month, he ſhould recover the whole Kingdom of <hi>Epirus</hi> ſave one City, out of the hands of the Turks, who had many and ſtrong Garriſons therein.</p>
                  <p>He was of ſo even a temper, that proſperity could not make him proud, nor fear daunt him, but alwayes kept the ſame cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:47532:104"/>of countenance as he uſed to do: his courage was invicible, of exceeding ſtrength and agility of body, modeſt and temperate in ſpeech; ſo politick, that he was by his very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies called, <hi>The Maſter of Policy;</hi> a great che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſher of valour in others, dividing the ſpoyl of his enemies amongſt his Souldiers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving no part thereof to himſelf; nay, having taken <hi>Muſtapha</hi> the Turkiſh General Priſoner, and receiving five and twenty thouſand Ducats for his ranſom, he freely divided it amongſt them, which made his Souldiers not only obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to his commands, but alſo ſo reſolute, that they feared not to ſet upon their enemies, though with never ſo great diſadvantage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward being the Razor that whetteth a Souldiers courage, and pricketh him forward to all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous enterprizes.</p>
                  <p>His perſonal valour was ſeen in his combat with <hi>Feri-Baſſa</hi> a great Commander of the Turks, whom he ſlew hand to hand; though ſome blame this as a fault, the loſs of a General, being a general loſs, who ſhould not expoſe himſelf to private dangers, and indeed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt overſight that he committed in all his Wars was ſoon after, when the Turks beſieged <hi>Croya,</hi> in whoſe Army he had ſo far ingaged himſelf, that he was by them on every ſide encloſed, and in great danger to have been ſlain or taken, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though through his valour he broke thorough, and made an eſcape: for <hi>the office of a good Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſiſteth not in the adventuring his perſon to manifeſt danger, but in the politick Government of his charge.</hi>

                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:47532:104"/>Of his great bounty to his Souldiers we have in part ſpoken before; we ſhall to that add an example of his Juſtice: <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Great ſent 14000 horſe-men againſt him, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of one named <hi>Debreas,</hi> who promiſed to perform wonders againſt him, but was by <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> overthrown, and by him ſlain, encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring hand to hand; all the enemies ſpoyl he divided amongſt his Souldiers, and gave <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breas</hi> Horſe and Armour unto one of his chief Commanders named <hi>Moſes,</hi> to another called <hi>Muſachius,</hi> who had behaved himſelf gallantly in that Battel, he gave a Priſoner, who by his outward part and behaviour ſeemed to be a man of ſome account. This Turk agreed with <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachius</hi> upon a ranſom of 200 Ducats, and thereupon drew forth the money out of a little bag which he had kept ſecretly about him, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it to <hi>Muſachius</hi> for his ranſom, who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it, told the Turk be muſt provide more money for his ranſom, for that was his own by Law of Arms being taken with his perſon. On the other ſide, the Turk alledged the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the payment of the full ſum agreed upon. This controverſie being brought before <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> he with great pleaſure heard them both, <hi>Muſachius</hi> pleading hard for his ranſom, and the Turk for his liberty: when they had both ended their Pleas, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> told them, that they both contended for that which in right was his, and neither of theirs; for the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (ſaid he) with the money, was both mine at firſt taking him; and although <hi>Muſachius,</hi> I
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:47532:105"/>gave you the Priſoner, yet not the money, which I knew not of, neither (ſaid he to the Turk) doth the concealing of it make it yours, who by the Law of Arms had loſt your ſelf and it to me. Afterwards he decided the buſineſs thus, allotting <hi>Muſachius</hi> the money he agreed for, and to the Turk his deſired Liberty.</p>
                  <p>Such was his heroical diſpoſition, that when the fore-named <hi>Moſes</hi> had revolted from him, and joyned himſelf to his enemy <hi>Mahomet,</hi> divers of his friends (according to the cuſtom of the world) aggravating his offence with many hard ſpeeches before <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> he could not abide to hear the ſame, but commanded them to hold their peace, and to uſe no more ſuch ſpeeches, only wiſhing that all Treaſon and evil fortune were together with <hi>Moſes</hi> gone out of <hi>Epirus.</hi> Such was alſo his celmency, that notwithſtand-the ſaid <hi>Moſes</hi> had with the power of the Turks given him a ſharp and terrible battel, in which he was overthrown and afterwards being in diſgrace with the Sultan, fled from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and prroſtrated himſelf before <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> with his girdle about his neck, in token that he had deſerved death, deſiring mercy upon his knees; he preſently granted him his requeſt, reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Proclamation all people from ſpeaking againſt him, and reſtoring his goods and offices again, which by his Treaſons he had confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</p>
                  <p>One great policy for the preſervation of his Country was, that upon the approach of his enemies, he took order, that all the proviſions
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:47532:105"/>of the Country ſhould be conveyed to places of refuge, and nothing left abroad for the Turks to prey upon; by which means, proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons many times grew ſo ſhort amongſt them, that ſtraying abroad for forrage, he with the more eaſe overcame them.</p>
                  <p>Many were the battels which he fought againſt the Turks, in all which he remained Victor, ſcarcely ever ſuffering the leaſt check, ſo that fortune ſeemed to wait upon him as his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid: It is reported of him, that having ſlain of the Turks in one Battel twenty four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and being informed the next day, that the remainder of them might eaſily be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed if preſued, he ſaid, <hi>O no, let ſome of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies live to report their own ſlaughter, and our victory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He having at another time brought the Turks unto a great ſtraight, they ſent unto him, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deliver up their Horſes and Arms, ſo that they might depart with their lives, to whom he returned this anſwer, <hi>That as they came into his Country without his Command, ſo ſhould they not by his leave depart thence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus victoriouſly reigned the ſpace of 24 years, <hi>January</hi> 17. in the great Climactori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal year of his age, he deceaſed at <hi>Lyſſa</hi> a City of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to which State he commended the tuition of his Wife, Son and Kingdom, till ſuch time his Son ſhould come of age. His death was worthily lamented of all Chriſtian Kings and Princes, he being the ſcourge and maule of the Turks, and the moſt careful watch-man and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:47532:106"/>invincible Champion of the Chriſtians: his dead body was with the general lamentation of all men magnificently buried in the Cathedral Church of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> at <hi>Lyſſa.</hi> About nine years after his deceaſe, the Turks having taken that City, they with great devotion digged up his bones, where happy was he that could but ſee or touch them; and ſuch as gained them, or any part of them, eſteemed of them as ſo high and precious Relique, that they cauſed them to be ſet in ſilver and gold to hang about their necks, or wear upon their bodies, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading themſelves, that by wearing of them they ſhould be partakers of ſuch good fortune, as had attended <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> whilſt he lived.

                  <p>Yet ſo much concerns it, that the Grand Seignior took his deliberate Enterpriſe upon Chriſtendome, from the very juncture of this peace; (being as underſtanding and converſant in the affairs of <hi>Europe</hi> as our ſelves) particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly his ancient league with <hi>France,</hi> gave him op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſuch Intelligence, which he never maintained with the Spaniard, as his neceſſary enemy.</p>
                  <p>For he knew well, that the ſtate of Chriſtendom could never endure a vacation, nor could be free from the viciſſitudes of intereſt, when ſo many Monarchs at leiſure had opportunity to project their ambition.</p>
                  <p>Nor was he ignorant of theſe Animoſities which perplexed the late Election of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour at <hi>Frankeford,</hi> not with what induſtry the French managed their luſt after the Imperial Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

                  <p>But while theſe things were debating the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours affairs were in an ill condition in <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania</hi> and upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> by the practiſes of Prince <hi>Apaffi,</hi> upon the diſcontents of ſeverall Garriſons for want of pay, inſomuch that <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelheyt</hi> and <hi>Clauſenburg</hi> revolted and put the Towns into the hands of the ſaid Prince, who plays the Turks game more openly then hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he had done; with theſe Towns the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent

Withall Forces under Grneral <hi>Souches</hi> were ordered that way to confirm the places that ſtood, but it is perceived that money is the beſt expedient to retain them in ſo many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Empire, and the diſaffection of the Countrey, who have an itching ear after <hi>Apaffi's</hi> propoſals, and were never much in love with the Auſtrian Family, becauſe of their Reſtraint upon the reformed Religion; and with thoſe pretences <hi>Apaffi</hi> gains mightily upon them; ſo that without they be ſuddenly awed by ſome advantage on the Emperours ſide they will undoubtedly accept of him for their Prince and Governour; and this is the condition of thoſe parts, by many ſuppoſed like to be the ſeat of the war this Summer.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> The late Expedition of Generall SERINI into the Turks Country.</head>
               <p>Htherto had the Chriſtian Army been only defenſive, to repell the force and injury offered by the Barbarians in their cauſeleſſe and ungrounded Invaſion of the Emperours Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, when Winter ſummoning their Aſian and Southern people to warmer quarters, gave the noble <hi>Serini</hi> (who had ſcarce breathed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween action and deſigne, ſuch was his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary vigilence over this enemy) a little reſpit and pauſe to confider in what way to requite this their violence by returning it in the ſame meaſure upon their Dominions.</p>
               <p>And it pleaſed providence ſo to favour and to ominate his enterpriſe, that the mildneſſe and clemency of the weather which had thawed the conjunction of the Turks and Tartars (who waited for Froſt and Ice to give them paſſage into the next Province,) and diſſipated them into remote quarters for proviſion and ſubſiſtence, about which they fell to blows, ſoon after tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it into ſeaſonable cold weather, and gave advantage to the Hungarian Army, enforced with the ſupplies under Count <hi>Hohenlo,</hi> to begin the Expedition which was about the beginning of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> new ſtile,</p>
               <p>The whole Army conſiſted of thirty thouſand
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47532:134"/>men well reſolved, under the conduct of this noble Chieftain, who had given ſuch eminent proofs of his Military ſufficiencies, and was ſolely capacitated to the preſent undertaking, as a perſon acquainted with the places deſigned upon, by reaſon of his extract thence, and the ancient original of his Family, endowed once there with great poſſeſſions, but ſwallowed, and now eaten up by Turkiſh Timar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the Turks of the other ſide being a conſiderable Garriſon, as the importance of the place requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſeeing his intentions endeavoured all they could by continuall ſhooting to enterrupt his work; but his great guns ſo annoyed and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them, and helped forward the deſtruction of the ſiege attempted by fire and all other waies of Mine, that in a nights time a great part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was quite broken and fallen into the River, the Turks being forced to deſert the ſlation and the defence thereof, for which it is reported that many of the Officers are now under queſtion, and will be ſeverely puniſhed by the grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, who is highly enraged and vexed at the buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>There being no more to be done to the bridge, the Count ſpent the next of his fury up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Country, which he layd in aſhes round about, there being no leſſe then 1000 Villages which are reported to have been burnt by him, and herein he did not onely ſatisfie his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar revenge, many of the places formerly belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to his Anceſtors, and detained by the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47532:135"/>Turks, but left the enemy nothing to ſubſiſt on either for man or horſe, if he ſhould come that way. They that have ſeen this deſolation, ſay that it is a moſt ruful ſpectacle, not a ſtick or ſtraw remaining, or to be ſeen for many miles together. Few priſoners came to his hands, for the Landlords ſuſpecting what would happen, had timely removed themſelves upon news of of his approach: and as for their Boors, they are not deemed, or to be taken as priſoners of war, on either ſide.</p>
               <p>With the terrour of theſe exploits being now upon his return, for that a report was very rife, that the enemy had joyned, &amp; made haſte after him, he came before <hi>Quinque Eccleſiae,</hi> or 5. <hi>Kercken,</hi> and ſummoned the Town, menacing all extemity if they delayed a ſurrender or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged this Army in a ſiege or aſſault, &amp; the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Garriſon ſo diſſembled a fearful comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that part of his Forces thinking the town their own, drew within reach of their Canon, which was very plentifully diſcharged among them, and a number of Officers of note, and the forwardeſt ſouldiers ſlayn therewith: which ſo provoked the General, that he commanded a preſent aſſault to be given, and the Town to be ſtormed on every ſide, which after a ſhort but ſtout reſiſtance was entred, and immediately plundered, and then fired, and ſacked: no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being given. The mean while, thoſe that had time to fly made to the Caſtle, where they were received, and which ſtood ſtill out, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Serini</hi> could not dwel upon a ſiege, as in truth his men being ſo harraſſed and tired out, it
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47532:136"/>been very imprudentiall for him to have done.</p>
               <p>But leaving them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thus bent upon an obſtinate defence, and having gained glory enough by the ſacking of the Town, he paſſed by <hi>Zigeth</hi> (famous for his Noble grandfather) and with the ſame fury ſet upon a town called <hi>Segeſs</hi> not far diſtant from thence, which he carried likewiſe by aſſault, and put the Garriſon to the ſword, leaving therein a Garriſon of his own, which wil be in danger to be loſt; as lying betwixt <hi>Canyſa</hi> (a ſtrong Fortreſſe of the Enemies) <hi>Alla Regalis</hi> and <hi>Zigeth,</hi> if the Count come not to its relief, as he is engaged to do upon another account, for that he left his great Artillery likewiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about which his occaſions muſt oblige him to fetch home, or he intended another expedition back again upon a further proſecution.</p>
               <p>Having thus accompliſhed his deſign he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about the end of <hi>February,</hi> when moſt men that boded his deſigne, and feared he had been engaged too far beyond any poſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, could not but admire the excellence and Felicity of his Conduct, attended with ſo many great ſucceſſes; but what ever his glory is, which is his own, it is no way proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that terrour which he hath caſt upon the Turk, who dread his name as they did that of <hi>Huniades</hi> and <hi>Scanderbeg;</hi> and it is not to be doubted, but by the bleſſing of God upon his life, he may prove ſuch another ſcourge to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, People.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> The Intereſt of all the Princes in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom upon the accompt of Policy and Religion in a War with the Turk.</head>
               <p n="1">I.

               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:47532:137"/>II. It follows unavoidably that the Chriſtian Princes are very much concerned to lay aſide that meanneſſe of deſigns, and enterpriſes, wherewith this laſt century they have undervalued themſelves; the petty <hi>acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">III. For our ſins multiplying, and our hereſies making up their full meaſure, when we would not live under the eaſie yoke of Chriſt: we were brought under the intollerable tyranny of the Infidel <hi>Choſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wey</hi> and <hi>Hunmer,</hi> who overthrew our Religion, and propagated Mahumetaniſme by the juſtice of God, and through the ſpreading nature of evil by permitting carnal liberty (a bait that will catch all fleſh) by promiſing a ſenſual Paradiſe which is more taking with mens experiences than a ſpiritual one is with their hopes, and by the power of the Sword which effectually teacheth the conquered the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Conquerours hath improved it ſelf to that fearful latitude &amp; extent as threateneth to out Chriſtianity from the earth, the Turks ſucceeding the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and adding to their Dominions <hi>Turcomania, Perſia, Egypt, Syria, Greece,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of Europe, as it is at this day. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto this dreadful power the Intereſt of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47532:137"/>Princes is either common to them all, or elſe pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to ſome: that which is common to all beſides the preſent invaſion and terrour, Is</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Religion the common happineſs, and common care of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is that which ties us to the moſt high God in duties, and the moſt high God to us in mercies, that bleſſeth all we ſet our hands unto, that is our honour in the fight of the Nations; that is the great improvement of our Natures; the great reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of mankind; the inward Counſels of God, the Charter of eternity written in the blood of Chriſt, copied down to us in the blood of Martyrs, our fore-fathers, who expect that we ſhould tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them down to poſterity: this religion, for whoſe defence you are ſet, by whoſe God you reign, by whoſe precepts and ſanctions your Thrones are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, intreats your ſuccours, prays your aſſiſtance in her diſtreſſe, and hopes you will not deny her prayers, as you would not have the prayers ſhe taught you denyed in a time of need. It is your honour to help God againſt the mighty, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade his Kingdom, as it will be your happineſs to be helped by him againſt the mighty that invades yours: he can prevail without you, your greatneſſe extendeth not unto him; you cannot ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him; would you have your thrones eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſs; your people tied unto you in conſcience: your Kingdomes civilized and paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: your borders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in peace and plenty; your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ingenuous and free: your times knowing and happy, and your names as laſting as letters, in time ſtir up your ſtrength: quit your ſelves
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47532:138"/>like men, maintain Religion and it will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you: or would you ſee cruel tyrannies, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in the blood of Kings at every ſucceſſion: Thrones environed with heaps of vaſſals and ſlaves; no Nobles in the Court, nor Gentlemen in the Countrey: no free men in the Land: no natural affections to wives or children: no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance to poſterity: no memory of Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors: no Morality, or Learning: no Arts or Sciences: would you be the reproach of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind and humane ſociety? and ſee neither peace to him that goeth out, nor to him that cometh in? but the whole earth covered with violence, oppreſſion, rapine, uncleanneſſe and blood: with ſuch enormities as the ears that heareth them would tingle at: or would you live under the promiſes of this life and that which is to come, where grace and glory is diſpenſed, and no good thing withheld from them that fear God: where you ſhall be bleſſed in the City, and in the field, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit of the ground; in your buſhel and your ſtore, when you come in, and when you go out: where the Lord ſhall command the bleſſings upon you, and whatſoever you ſet your hands unto.</p>
               <p n="5">V. But more particularly is Religion become the Intereſt of every Kingdom: 1. Of <hi>Spaine,</hi> whoſe zeal for the Catholique Religion is the beſt prop of that Monarchy: its that which obligeth the Pope and Papiſts in all Kingdoms to promote his greatneſs againſt the Proteſtants and the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> to ſerve his deſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>France.</hi> 2. Of the Popa and the Princes
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47532:138"/>that hold of him in <hi>Italy</hi> in the right of the Church whoſe patrimony lieth in the ſame bottom with their Religion, and whoſe eſtates are entailed upon them by the holding of their Chriſtianity. 3. Of <hi>France</hi> whoſe power is impowred by indulging Proteſtants, and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them againſt the encroachments of <hi>Spaine.</hi> 4. Of the <hi>Low-countries,</hi> the <hi>Hans-towns</hi> of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and the Princes, with <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whoſe religion hath propagated the liberty of the four firſt of theſe, and upheld the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the two laſt: all which had been ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> power, had not their Religion knit their intereſt together, and they who were otherwiſe at a great diſtance in ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and civil concernes become ſo united in their faith: in a word, the Lawes, the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, the conſtitutions and policies of <hi>Europe</hi> are ſo enterwoven with Chriſtian religion, that if it be pulled down the government of <hi>Europe</hi> falleth down with it.</p>
               <p n="6">VI: But Religion is not all, though it be enough to engage the ſtates and lives of all that profeſſe it, for the Chriſtians have many more engagements upon them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Namely, the <hi>Emperour</hi> hath his borders to ſecure, and his rebellious people, who have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſanctuary under the Turk to ſubdue every yeare, untill this ill neighbour be removed: as hath <hi>Poland, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Muſeovy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> have the <hi>Levant</hi> and other places to be ſetled, which cannot be expected as long as this abſolute Tyrant gives Laws to ſea and land.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:47532:139"/>3. The <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and other Popiſh Princes have the yoake the Pope hath ſet upon their necks (to enſlave them to him more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily then they do the people to themſelves) to remove, which they could never yet attempt, but their Ghoſtly father chaſtized them with an Invaſion of <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Moors,</hi> or deluded them into an holy warre, where he had his privy projects beyond the publique deſigne, that (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Your ſatisfaction is at hand, for there is no danger in Auxiliaries, if 1. they have no Caſtles or Garriſons in their hands. 2. If they are no more then the Natives may muſter. 3. If they engage a Common enemy. 4. If they are ſo mixed as the united forces of Chriſtendome are ſupported. 5. If they are commanded by the natives of that Country which they aſſiſt: or at leaſt by perſons whoſe chief dependance is on that power which they have: but more particularly, are the Proteſtants in <hi>Germany</hi> affraid of Papiſts? they may be ballanced with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.
